Marge
Hoot

Hotel

A drive up trashcan
We live in a society of laws
Oh being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have
Oh let's get out of here
I wanted to die choking on food
When God shuts a door he opens a window
Which used to be a beautiful thriving greenhouse til I was hired to run it
I'm so stupid
Thank God it's you
That's punishment enough
I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear
You're not looking
That guy's hilarious
What's going on
No couches either
Go to bed

Huh mmm not bad
None for me Marge
What does it look like
Like one time they were having this race with this stupid old timey bicycles with the big wheel in front
Now I'm not one to make trouble but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old or classic # area code lives on the rich side of town
I came to see the kids
Sir I need to know where I can get some business hammocks
If anyone wants me I'll be eating alone in the basement
Relax with the team we put together our book'll fly off the shelves and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville
Why don't you play this
Oh so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation huh

That's because I hate her
Haven't we all
I would've been a winner instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce
I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly
See ya the next time we need your signature
Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair
But why
Roll it Louie

My one weakness
That's the car I think about when I make love to my wife
It's my problem

And the view is beautiful inspirational nauseating
You can't feel it
That's what I've been saying
Wipe that smile off your face
I don't want to go so if he asks me to go I'll just say yes
I get enough of that from my Dad
Oh great

The loneliest man in the world
It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner
Hey baby banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes
Do that card counting thing again
But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me
Okay
Stop
IF YOU DESPISE POLITE LEFT HANDERS
Boy this is easy
Finally
I'm sure he had more important things to do
Take care ladies

This marriage is gonna last forever
I'm Max Power
Can we get high from the fumes
Look Marge
My boss
They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me
Let's see uh Oh I'm no good at this
And I'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely
Lemme set the scene for you Marge
No they weren't all happy Days
I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders my best friend
Hey boy why don't I do that for you
Here's how it's gonna go down
Heh heh I know what you mean
Your delicious brains
You monster
Hee hee hee
HEEERE'S THE ANGEL
Finished with fifteen seconds to spare
I'll tell you what's goin on
Something I should have done a long time ago
Somebody's got tired little legs
But if like me you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things you'll prefer roulette
Please please please please please
I've never been so miserable in all my life
No no
No it doesn't
Okay she lives at one Ocean View Drive
What
I guess this is the time to tell you
Shoo
You know it's something both kids and adults can enjoy
and that lasted about five years
Now now honey
You sunk my Scrabbleship
A pox on thee
I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world but I took care of my family and that used to be enough
You're a girl
Uh listen is it true you priest guys can't ever you know
She can't have gotten far she has no arms
But our sames go right down to the bone
She's gonna marry me
No I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve
I wouldn't know where to begin
Rainier Wolfcastle
Hey how come you never play your guitar anymore
Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great
Deeper you pusillanimous pilsner pusher
We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse
I also sleep G'night Mommy
Some day that bowl will overflow and I'll be there
Anything
Then suddenly
Oh no you don't
Remember what the instructor said
No
Oh
There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard
You monster
Come on
Marge it's not the diaper it's what's inside
Hmm
Sweetie Daddy doesn't have enough money for that unless they take a check
So how long is Senor Homer out of town for

We're doomed
Come on beautiful I can't do the job without you so what do you say
Oh no let me out
Uh no that was me
All right Bart

U.S.A
Ohh I'd say you were luminous magnetic incandescent
No goose bumps
Really
She's just like Clark Kent
You are a vampire
Save the Children
How come it's not open yet
Name me one gay Indian
They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it
I think Bart's gone crazy
Or
My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table
I just lost my appetite
She made me spend time with the kids
Oh yeah
I'm in
You
You're my only friend
The next day we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement
What have you done to our house
I must see more
And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars
Marge
Why the sweet talk Apu
Nothing's changed
Don't lean out of the tra
They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me
It's like being a baby only you're old enough to appreciate it
Does anything from the movies actually work
Kids kids kids
Well thanks for your time
Gonna run out the clock in Florida eh
Yeah
I admit it
It's been happening to me all my life

Hey Flanders next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it
If you don't mind
Access denied
Please Mr. Burns pretend you work for me
He'll be killed
Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater
No
From now on walking is my beer
Arizona smells funny
Sir as a complexion scientist I must advise you against using any more
Whack
Don't thank me Lurleen you should be thanking your brain
Marge I don't hate your mother
What a nice idea son
Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons
Original not barbecue
Chloe may have a flashy job but you're the backbone of this family
NO
They're all so expensive
The train
Now that I am the law I'm gonna make a lot of changes around here
Bart I'll need some clean urine
Now to drop gracefully through the windshield
Now you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder
It's the Grumple
Oh sure I do
Don't worry
Ow
At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you
Pie Man is not your father little girl
And he appears every Friday night like Urkel
Kent Brockman
Once you go Vatican you can't go back again
We done here
What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt
I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy
Think Homer
Oh Arthur Fortune
Geez that dog has more education than I do
Marge

Good
Those guys are probably FBI informants
I guess it's just how I was raised
What the Where's Christmas

I told you I have too much time on my hands
But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids
What
I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death maze

The Dalai Lama

Couldn't agree more
And now my darling it's finally time for romance
I don't know Marge at all
No food allowed in bank
No I'm gonna do it
But Ginger honey I am not the catch I appear to be
Hey this sounds like fun
Even Christian videos with talking vegetables
Anyone else want a beer
And peace
Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake
Marge Marge Marge

Unregardless I will no longer be a slave to this
I'll get a second job
Oh that sounds hard
My enjoyment
But you should have seen em Marge
Do me
That's it
But still rich
Now I'm just stuck
I don't know why we ever left in the first place
Marge I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail
Let's never fight again
And you won't unless you can leap through fire
You know if you tip the glass there won't be so much foam on top
You butchers
It was Bart
I knocked her up
And when is this weekend
Ow
You're welcome
The poison must be in the steak
I accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose
Fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight
I need money for Christmas can I get anything for this Joe DiMaggio baseball card
Bodily functions are a natural thing
Let's go out for some frosty swirls
This rolling is just temporary
Or implode
Might as well rub dirt in my eyes
Why you little
I get this
This is my chance to relax with people from work I never get to see
Can you swing a sack of door knobs
I suck
SOMETHING SOMETHING LIMBO SOMETHING
Your little game is over

She's waiting in the living room
Hey everybody
Wait

No way
Sorry
Flanders landlords like you are the scum of the earth
Kiss my asphalt
Hey
You're right Marge I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats
Don wanna go
Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room
Maggie
Let's hear it
What did Carl think
Confirmation of my attitude
I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age
This is great
Oh if only it were that easy Marge
Follow the what
Your father me beat City Hall
Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass this is the worst
I've got more bones than that guy
Yeah well while I'm gone you'll do what he says
Why didn't you call me
Really
I'll miss you Pumpkins but I just can't share your bleak world view
God bless God amen
Uh the last one
And I feel that you hear my shame
Hey you found my needlenose pliers
Well there's a dull ache certainly
You'll see
I'd do it if you were stupid
Honey our time together is precious to me
This is everybody's fault but mine
We do

That's right
Es mi dia primero
I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work
Not tonight Marge
Hey Apu

My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge and they brought us good luck
Baby to Marge

Well if he didn't have any guns I'd show him a thing or two
Watch and learn
And my dream is to get rid of Bart
Aw lousy Wiggum
Son that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever
Seems a shame to chuck out these cross country skis
Can't hurt the boy
How come you didn't rescue me
Do I smell tarragon crusted Atlantic salmon
His wife is dead

He'll tire himself out soon
Lisa that was just a radio show
Forget the baby's medicine
Hey guys
Garbage in garbage can
That's ridiculous
Maybe you're right
You're killing me
Moe I was just thinking if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you and your ham
Daddy will kill it
Nuts to this
You mean tell her I love her
Then yes
We're doomed
If your mother wasn't so fancy we could shop at the gas station like normal people
Boy if you were half as smart as you think you are you'd clean up your act
Wonderful Homie
She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave
At that time I had no idea Maggie even existed
Marge can't we get some clear plates

Take it off
You've gotta improvise Lisa
Gods eh
Woo Hoo

Good fire

Yeah this economy is tough on everyone
Ow

The only problem is I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman
Wait I'm gonna be driving
Marge I'm confused
Oldies
EATING MAKES ME THIRS TY
Look I'll even eat some
And everything is as it should be
I would if it wasn't for the kids
No child of mine will go without anything ever
We're free
When we do things together they always turn out badly for me
Oh I get it
Do it again
Wow
That's it
Okay we'll use a plan
And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight
Son the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty which appears to be everything
I'm sorry I can't do it
Can't even go in my own kitchen Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters
Sorry
Throw it away
Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists
Savages

Back to the horses
Well we need help
Ahhh what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day
You wouldn't understand
Hit the thing

Over my dead body
Basically we become a family of traveling acrobats
I'm gonna be a hippie just like Mom wanted
Let's go
And I won't be back for ten minutes
You mean like will apes be our masters
I put you in humiliating commercials for money which I spent on myself
If anyone dies it should be him
Oh just great
No no he can't be
Plus I designed a state of the art stadium
I could sit in the aisle
I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference
We put all the craziness behind us and now it's time to get back to what matters the show and the Sunday comic strip
You too Fred Thompson
These are the people who saw an over crowded marketplace and said me too
Fine

I'm gonna have to shut it down myself
Especially his children
God Bless America
Absolutely
Woo hoo
You know there's a lesson here for all of us it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff
Oh I think I know what you're doing wrong
I'll start with a couple of pizzas then a complimentary tango lesson and I'll cap it off with a smooth refreshing colonic
Oh I'm fine
Observe
Follow me
But in some ways my family is like a family too
Sweetie you've always been beautiful but now you're my silver belle
Helmet
That meeting is tonight
Oh that's just superstition
It'll burn up in our atmosphere and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head
Yes you

Oh Marge I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me
Oh that's such a first take answer

Hey
Two months ago I didn't know what the word dumbbell meant
How did you get in here

And change slots for every coin from penny to quarter
Mayday

I'm on the top
For crying out
Venting prevents explo si on
I don't want your pity or your money
So what do I do again
I just judge them on the color of their skin
I think I'm gonna take a walk
That's my boy
That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life

Marge my darling
That's not true
Okay everyone straight ahead is my big surprise
The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt

Now who's the filthy sleezebag uh Marge

Things started out great
You know I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse
That's almost a thousand dollars

Bed goes down
Five days
Do you know the hours I worked
Soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft
Oh man
What's the good word
No way this guy's a winner
You're the Hell's Satans
But first let's see it again in super slow motion

Yeah but first I talked to the engineer
One at a time
Uh let's see # # #
I'll find out what he's up to
I guess I'll go and stretch my legs

I'll show Flanders
It's a murder honey
I never found true happiness until I met Marge
My hair
You've probably heard a lot of bad things about Families Come First
So hot so sticky
I can't go back to living on the surface world
Well behaved kids
And I owe it all to this feisty feline
Something's wrong

Now that she's a better person we can see how awful we really are
In your face everybody

Probably a reminder to relax more
If some burglars come it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation
I guess I'll have to watch that now
And that blonde cutie
What dear
Kill wealthy dowager
Can't someone else do it
Like the other night we were fighting about money
He's gone

Okay everyone
Oh I have time to see one little movie
Professor Frink
Daughter
So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back or you can go out there and find your dog

You think so
Don't worry son
Stupid script
Well you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it

What paper

Ask me anything
Hey there's something you don't see in a toilet every day
Kelly

Marge not in front of the refrigerator
Look I already encased the telephone in concrete
Come on

The end will come at sundown
Think about the irony
Yes I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes
The demolition derby is next month
But if he starts to wig out try to lure him into the cellar

Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said
Oop looks like my shift is over
Marge

I passed out on your turtle and killed it
Uh oh
You callin me a liar Carl
I wish I'd brought a TV
Why not
I forgot it
Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go
I know
Swim my pretties
Hmm
Here's a corner
Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U
The Simpsons are going to Blockoland
Now he's just a stinking flight attendant
Against my wishes
And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing so later I can say that I already told you

Exactly
Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful
Ooh Maggie made some new friends
Relax

Woo hoo
Say doctor can you do something about my searing pain
I found them on the night stand this morning
I am Homer Simpson
Lisa
Mardi Gras eh

I'm sweating like Roger Ebert
But most of all I remember the music
Marge is gone
The world will end next week
Probably digging for drugs
I need some supplies a keg of beer and a six pack to hold me till I tap the keg
Lisa
WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE THAT'S AMORE WHEN THE WORLD SEEMS

Beer bring pain
Ooh I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life
Haven't you haven't you

By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile
Carnies took over our house
Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career
But I'm so sweet and tasty
They charge for materials and labor

I don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back
What am I Kreskin
You wanna do my dance after you score
Kids I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge
I like to watch Lamar Odom play X Box while his giant wife yells at him

God I love her
Y No
A
Oh yeah uh I was at the flower shop today too

You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman
I have a Boyle on my ass
We still have time to catch a movie
I can still hear her
MY HORSE MUST LOSE
I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me
Sign an autograph or two support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book
You're right

Pleasant aroma rich full body well aged and the wine's not bad either
Ooh one of the turkeys fell behind the bed
Would you read To Kill A Mockingbird for me and if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the Southern Gothic tradition that would be great
And that's the story of April Fool's Day
Check check and check
You don't have a doorknob
It's date night
People know your name but you don't know theirs

Paw me
Ooh that's lucky
Now to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio
Or the big picture
Marge I could stand here and argue with you but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk
Potatoes are clean
This is just like The Deer Hunter
You guys are still married

Who took my false teeth
Oh Marge what if I wind up as some vegetable watching TV on the couch
So I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went
This is gonna be great
You can't spell dishonorable without honorable
I sat on something sharp
Oh there's so much I don't know about astrophysics
No I do not know what Schadenfreude is
Minds blown you're welcome
No matter where you go in this life you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul

The past never had a chance man

You saved my marriage and not for the first time

Remember there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success

Mr. Simpson do you think it's appropriate for a ten year old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss

You know son I've been doing a lot of thinking
And Maggie you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa
That's funny
Marge isn't life funny
Stupid horse

We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife
Kids there's something I have to tell you your mother and I are wetting the bed
Oh uh and there was something else
Okay this is it
Okay gotta run
Boy you're a great stacker
Oui oui
Why you little
After years of disappointments with get rich quick schemes I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme
No

That's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in Albuquerque
The kids are happy you smell like Meryl Streep and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted
C'mon Lisa
Man
I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes
Those frogs are eating all their crops
If you turn that security camera around you can sleep and no one will ever know

Oh my God
Marge
That is not a worm
If you won't talk to me I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down
And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it
Something that would really make money
You're saying that you know women
One snow angel comin up

That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me
Why on earth would a child go to the zoo
Those bullies
Thank you
Why you little oh I can't

A man who's not afraid to cry
Well I

Huh
We didn't have much money so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line
Oh spirit

Celebrate your commonality
You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself
Up bup

Hello

Someone you'd never expect
Faster
Population you

Oh Bart what a man you've become
Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park

I bet they're having the time of their life
But Mr. Burns gave me my job
Yeah who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo
We can just hold hands or sit and talk
Where's the car
Lisa when you get to be our age you'll learn a few things like when a sign says Do Not Feed The Bears man you'd better not feed the bears
Why you little

That's the sneeze guard
You're feisty
Krusty you've let everyone down

You got it buddy
I'm sensing some negative vibes here
From now on the Simpsons are living intermittently
Their names were Bonnie and Clyde

Okay I'm heading out now
Maggie wants to be with me

Axes

A tale of two young outlaws in love
What an age we live in
Because those are car words
How about that Selma flying all of us to China for no apparent reason
But what if I can't find any commercial rental property
I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy
Yes better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man
A little further back
And Marge you're a consultant

You know what would be surprising
I love you but I must kill you
Ah yeah you
How many times have I told you not to bite your sist
Oh Marge I just had a couple of beers
Hey we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie
Why don't you just tell everybody
Lucky drunks
But I know who can
But I threw away my camera
Yeah like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff
I think that if you told me I would remember
It'll be fun
Yoink
For you I'll give up rum based cocktails
I think I'm having a heart attack
We're still inside
It's the land of sleep
Gee I wish I could son but we've already left the gift shop
Relax Marge
Lenny it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals
There's a hundred little punks graduating from Syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass
Uh huh
It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards
We gotta get outta this Ned
I need a new job that provides full health benefits
Krackle was my favorite
Well for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style
I'll endanger you
Ah I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for
His corpse is climbing the building
Sure
But what would turn Bart into a man fast
Thanks Moe
A dinosaur
Marge don't discourage the boy
I was thinking of chicken wings
Ah ha a sand horse
You know just to shake things up
It's worth every cent
Don't worry I planned for this
There's no such thing as a talking dog
A Flaming Homer
I know maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots
Okay why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed
I don't even have a special tooth problem
Well I am missing the back of my head
What a movie
Hey I've always had an interest in art dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr

Don't tell her I raised my voice
Apu I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again

That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him
I have serious mental problems
I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again
Dad you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not
What I was trying to say and maybe I didn't use the right words was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail but as coffins go
Uh excuse me I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best
Not me
How bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars
Delicious caulk

Stupid bicycle

Lyndon LaRouche was right
It was either kill him or kill no one
Jump boy
Stir up some controversy
Killer umbrellas

You're on your own
You know I just got a little chill when you said my name
It's a mega store

Always growing
I'll take that Too slow Drooly Joe Peek a boo
Marge look at them staring at that idiot box
Bart this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced
You you really scared us
He's cheating on Selma
I guess there's only one way out of our problems a murder suicide pact
Anybody care what this guy thinks
It's just for as long as his mother's living here
You know um it is a special occasion
Maybe it's time I gave something back
Marge did I ruin your life
We're number one
Okay
Nice muscles
Knock it off
No no no no no no
Flanders I don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes
You're welcome honey
That's just the engine struggling
And would it kill you to put some fennel in it
But I want it now
Or a snowman
Everybody can teach a class but me
Oh it's a great hat
That'll be the sun
Oh my God
Look I know it wasn't our best season
We need to lay down some ground rules
What am I supposed to do
Because we love them Jackass
Ohh my son doesn't stand a chance
Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them
Now that we're alone Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear
You promised Lisa to help her with her costume
Shoe goes on shoe goes off
Look we can sit here all day and play the blame game or we can start freaking people out
Yes
And
Starting right now I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve
Let's trim the mark

You could ride a walrus to work
Hi honey

Sorry I'm all out of ice cream

Well if they care that much about whether you have a mini bike then they weren't really your friends
To a heckuva blacksmith
You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow
I want another beer
Would you like to wear mittens or go commando
What's the code word
Oh
Hey let's hold hands and skip inside
We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another but what about the victims
I can go to work any way I want
The phone's dead
And for starters your old man is gonna teach you how to ride your very first bike
Yeah maybe it was too soon
Absolutely
You've got to hide me from PBS
Really
Ow
Really
But not any more baby
I'll be just fine
The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing the crime of murder
Now let's not get into who smells like what
As the Bible says Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's
Shut up
Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown boy
It's really brought us closer together
Wait a minute
And if you do it son you'll get the same
We won
My father and I were never really close
Why oh I give up
And mine was snakes and yours was
Today's the first which means it was last month which means you're being ridiculous

Been a while since our wives got together huh
A group of crows is called a murder
According to this you're both idiots
Marge what do you think
Finally a chance to relive my golden college years
Marge
The score damn you
I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley like where the pins go after they're knocked down
Our first one was so crummy I had to make it up to you
And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob
What does sequestered mean
Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need
I GO TO RIO I'M IN RIO AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH I'M IN MY SPEEDO
There are no flights to London till five
Anything

You know what you should serve Marge
Hey I'm trying to eat here
When do we have wacky adventures
You're not leaving me
Oh dear God no
Hey there son
From now on we use regular toilet paper not that fancy quilted kind
But the evil ogre Barney had left the men's room in the most wicked condition
Kathleen Turner

Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat
I want to shoot a lion in the face fight Muhammad Ali and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras
Don't play Olde Springfield or as it is sometimes known Sun City
And so on
You're gonna listen to my story
Not so fast
Now we have to drive it straight to Rome where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield
The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want isn't that wonderful
Screw you guys
We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls
Must squeeze harder
We need it

Sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true isn't it sweetie
Mmm soggy smoky hero

I'm the worst Poochie ever
He's gone
I said God bless America
Did somebody say a perfect game

All right Son
Please

Class President
Marge
Why you little
I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave
I command you
You lie
What are all these presents
It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison
Uh uh
Oh Marge I never thought you'd see me again
Sure
How about you Barney
I don't think you realize what you're saying
We've had a lot of great memories
It was all a dream
Fading
Uh huh that's Mr
Look look

Tri tip

Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents Oh that's a lovely touch
Don't worry honey
Anything to trick my daughter into liking me

It's not another punch in the face is it
Okay Marge let's go
To their parents
Gentlemen I am going to catch General Sherman
This is such an eye opener
Jump in Marge
I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life and you're totally late
We're gettin by okay
This is Homer Simpson from America
Oh look what you did
Can I keep the name after I'm done
What they don't suspect is that I'm into this
To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan
Narc
Hm now without lettuce
Oh look at all the people who can buy and sell me
I'm sorry Marge but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the liberal media
You're cooking what for dinner
No
Ow
Hey kids
Oh yeah
Now you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did
YOUR HAIR STREAKED WITH SUN LIGHT
And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better
Lots of snakes though
I'm great at these
Nothing
Calling all cars come out with your hands up
That suit's a little revealing isn't it
Pass the cookie dough
This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach
Oh no the hunter has become the hunter
Yes
If we don't get a seat in the splash zone I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing
I can't read ahead I promised Lisa I wouldn't
Just don't do it anymore
Ow
Missed me
Bart did you hear that
You can't close
Marge please
Marge it's making my eyes better and it's legal
Now this next one's for the ladies
Daddy will fix that broken animal
No no
Really

If we buy a new car we get our parking validated for free
I just underwent a procedure to increase my IQ fifty points
Hey everybody pees in the pool

Alcohol fueled car
Holy cow you're as big as a house
Ow
Thank you
Except earring boy
Check it out beavers
There's a lot you don't know about me Marge
So do you wanna wang chung tonight
And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight
Even after I bought her that hockey fight tape
Let me hear you play
A Wait a second
I made it the whole day without seeing her again
Uh perhaps this is inappropriate but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room that I can't help wondering about
You said there was a job for me
What do I do to be a good guy
I'm on board
Woo hoo
Bring me two of every animal
Are you sure you wanna do this so fast
A lot of that went in my lungs
Oh my God
Y'ello
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised
It's the perfect thing to straighten you out
It's a big snooze
Is that what Alex would say
Is that splashing or drowning
Listen Marge
Stupid double snuggler's hitch
Hey Fat Tony
Believe me Marge nothing bad could possibly come of this
Shut up shut up shut up
I always wake up just before the good part
And give these cigars to your children
Oh you mean about you
Yeah isn't this place great
You can't change the rules in the middle of the game
Quiet
Hello Marge
Well you may not be the smartest guys in the Army
Lucky shmucky
I'm both
Hold me
And the Smurfs
I don't know what that middle word means
That's false advertising
Marge flying in private jets is great and all but it's just too dangerous
Say hi to your other brother and sister
How bout that house
Lenny Carl I know a lot of people bad mouth you and focus on how you suck but not me
Then when he asks you if you hate this country you just start crying and pretend you don't
Hey
I'm just gonna rest for a minute
Edison was just like me
Shut up Judge
No Marge there's one group that's always welcome in America immigrants without I.D
No way
So this is the Simpson family saying As you walk down the road of life
Yes
You bet
Well there's only one way to find out
Oh I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now
Oh my God
Marge I need a small favor
Angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of Headmaster Greystash
Uh we'll stick with the coins
But the guy I really hate is your father
Ooh look at it go
She's gone
Now I know I haven't been the best Christian
Oh I can't wait
Y'ello
Boy
Ow
Quirky
I wanted to see inside so I lit a Q tip
Wow
Come on pony up Flanders
Mmmmm
I rule this pseudo sport
You don't even eat lobster
I wish I could retire
A lot of blue hair
We didn't
Now if you'll excuse me I don't really like bourbon or business talk just good old Simpson family fun
What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time
I wanted to but your mother said kids might tease you
Okay
Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog
Yes tell us your story
Shiiiii pwreck
Oh here we are
What a great show real people with real problems
The kids are on
What do you mean
Nooooooooo
Apu I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife
It was just so funny
Marge my fringes are knotted again
I just poured myself a new glass of milk
If I don't finish this last bite you don't get my soul do you
Ha ha ha ha ha how we'll laugh
Oh yes I she does look pregnant
Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window
Then it's settled
Oh sure when he does something bad he's my father
Nobody loves oily Homer
Don't jinx it
You keep em talking
Go
Fish out of water
Here we go
Well this year's gonna be different
Hmm Back yard back yard toilet ocean don't know back yard Flanders mailbox Lenny's freezer tire fire
Come on Marge I want to shake off the dust of this one horse town
Great another job lost to a foreigner
Hey Ned
Wow
How could you
Get your own angel ya moocher
It's got that new bubble smell
Okay Maggie dog poison you're all involved so listen up
Ooo this robe's pretty soft
Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger
She can get on a plane
Huh
If you see a downed power line do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation
Sh sh shh
Mom
Here you go
Y'ello
Beat the lumps
And that's pretty much the end of it
Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan
Ooh Colostomizer
I hope it doesn't come to that
Oh I can't stand to see your mother unhappy
Sign this please
Aren't I great
Boy I'd like to smack that kid
Look Gabriel
But I don't know anything
Sir I demand satisfaction
No problem
I have absolutely no idea what's going on
And which way to the can
Look at that picture quality you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes
Bart you can't go to see that Itchy Scratchy movie
Relax Marge
I don't want to think about food I want to like it
Old Yeller and about eight Lassies and
You take that back
Bart eat your spinach
The kids can call you Hoju
Yes everyone loves rules
C'mon kids
I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie
Help I'm being kidnapped
Is the answer Japan
It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe
She sure knows how to swing it
Get used to it honey
No it's not that
But we never saw people like us on TV
groaning with a United Nations of donuts jellies rubbing elbows with cream filled the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves
She has a gift
Moe I think we may have perverted
This should be the greatest night of my life
I'm still hungry
You're giving me absolute power
I sure have pardner
OH MINDY YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING
Woo hoo
We're sure learning a lot about each other
Hey there was just air in mine
Some father
Boy I never thought I'd have my own dark room
Leeches
I need a mouth hole
Well I'm not finished
Attention lovers of free office supplies
I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush
Or as we say at OmniTouch a Progress Tree
And the one in my pants really hurt
Chosen for what oh mighty gherkin
Now here's how it works Lisa you say one thing then Bart you say another
She's gonna jump
He's my son and I don't want him
Don't know don't care
After everything I did you're going to abandon me
YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED WHEN THE O.J
Hey this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth that everything is just fine
But you've got me
Safety dance
Well this time you must be punished
Take it off
Mr. Burns you do this personally
Wowww
But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good
Oh I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business
It's sacrilegious I tell ya
Oh I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife
It's not all his fault
Ooh ooh ooh pick him
Safe at last
You see Saint Flanders is as crooked as you or me
I just felt a chill go through my very soul
Anyone but him
Hey Mister
Good but not great
Hel lo
Thanks guys
Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me
But before I do Marge there's something I want to ask you
Now scram
Which will put more green in the blue
That's a negatory good buddy
And you don't wanna cash in
This bulletin better swing
Well don't worry
I know you're gonna turn out great with or without your old man
I'm very happy to meet you
They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers
Oo my horoscope
Ned does everything with class
As long as you're here annoying me let's have a brainstorming session
Screw you
Do you have a table for the mayor
I guess my life isn't so bad
Oh well
I'll be your tutor
Whoa
Tell our side of the story
Thanks Marge
Marge pour vous
Maybe I should go home
I need to use the phone
Number one
NOT IN SPRING TIME
Yeah but this is what they're doing on campus
Take your time
I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT SHORT AND STOUT HERE IS MY HANDLE HERE IS MY SPOUT
Can your God do that
That's ridiculous
I didn't want them to know my size
Maggie was very young
The first nine were only a penny
I know
There's no time to waste
Burns stiffed us
No tongue eh
I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit
I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat
Flanders I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago
Ohh com'ere
To me that says I love you
Huh
What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me
Okay Plan B
When am I gonna be initiated
Marge I'm out of beer
Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love
Stupid Lisa
They take hundreds of magazines filter out the crap and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket
Wait
Oh we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock
Oh well of course everything looks bad if you remember it
So in August it's cold
And after the show you can come backstage for pizza and pop
Soon he was known as Fit Fat Tony then just Fat Tony for short
But you're close
And so are we
Hello
In theory
My new friend's name is Earl
Woo hoo
I can't let the boys see me with you
Okay everybody
Why you little
I'm down
After I catch my breath can we go home
Go away
Okay
Thank you
YOU BETTER BE STRONG
Canyonero
Aren't you gonna say bye
But with college behind us we'll need careers
Come here you butterball
If you like my song so much would you like to buy a tape
Coke and Pepsi are the same thing
It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane
Has the Joker taught you nothing
Hey it really is you
He's always one step ahead
D it up Marge
What the This is a gentleman's club
Just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured
They're okay with applesauce
But this is the chair right

LOOK OUT FOR WHAT
Your hands are too weak
Now either grab a stone or go to Hell
The individual doesn't matter

A mother can't die
This is perfect
And turn that upside down
Chief me too
Didn't you hear the song
Oh for goodness sake
Well I might as well use this pucker for something
I always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty
Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash
You know it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling
The car won't start
Yep no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns
How could you
Ah
I love this guy
Okay let's make a pact

Well not with that temper
I'm on a hunger strike starting right now
Then I'll do it
I'll treasure this poncho forever
Ow
Oh Lisa thank God you're okay
Oh so you're ashamed of us

I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this
Oh there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing
I started what from a what
Look at those suckers in their metal coffins
Mmm
I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight
If there was a law it would be against it
And when a man doesn't have his mother he winds up like me

But you're gonna make us millions
There and there
You think I should get it washed
Yo Lenny do you know anything about flying the blimp while drinking
Eh maybe I'll vote democrat

Where are we going
I've gotta do something to keep from going crazy
Hi Marge

If you're single you can come here every night
Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife
Actually Marge uh there uh was someone before you
Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done

Since the dawn of parking lots man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise
I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom
No one else is doing it
They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff

You're too dumb to tell a story
I mean emotionally it was terrible
Who
Chop chop dig dig
And chew tality
And feeling good is my hangover
This guy sucks

Hey you wouldn't say that unless there was a need to thank you
Wish I was deaf
Dee fense
Corporate jet
Next commercial

I know
Sure do
Hey maybe we should give Lisa this room
Get him
Don't worry baby
Shut uuuup
You have my undivided attention
Here you go
So how's Maude Flanders doin up there
