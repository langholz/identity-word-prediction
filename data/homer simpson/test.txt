WHILE TURNING GAY THE OTHER DAY A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
Ooh they're showing the filling now
If you love the Bible so much why don't you marry it
A cheese grater
Make it eh
Yeah I
I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap
But what about the guy who took my car
Don't even go there sister
Praise be Oliver
I won't let that man make you happy
After living like a billionaire this place is kind of a dump
Sorry Bart
We found a new home
Kids kids once you get hurt move aside and let other people jump
Woo hoo
What the Hell is this
Oh this is sadder than Tuesdays With Morrie
No
He's always mad
I'm your man
That wasn't a defeat it was a phased withdrawal
You are a senile buck toothed old mummy with bony girl arms and you smell like
I think it goes here
Heads up
What did they say about my scalp
We're doomed
Rock on
Do I ever
I'm giving you your wish to be a real boy
Wake up
I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead
I guess I have no choice
That bird
Nah it'd just be awkward what with the sex and all
Oh c'mon it plays itself
I got us some kick ass seats
And where will I walk
C'mon kids I went too far
Sometimes I think about gettin on a bus and never comin back
Have a dollar
I wouldn't say that
So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies
Don't make me choose
New billboard day
Nay
We sold it didn't we
Marge they're only human
Aww that's a nice friendly gal
Spoil er
Yeah well I have full tenure
But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses
Hey so are the Grammy judges
Anybody but Flanders
I'm really sorry but our family just can't handle both of you boys
What if I see something really weird in the sky
Better call Dr. Hibbert
Not for you it isn't
Why does every woman I try to talk to run into cans
I guess you had some higher purpose in mind
Oh really
Yes the sixties may be dead and gone and its spirit long since extinguished but its ideals live on
Let's see
It was
Not so fast
I mean I'm not perfect right
Whoa Marge who'd you piss off
How much do you tip a leg waxer
Hey now let's not do anything rash God is love right
Hey Moe
Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day what would be the best day to see it
Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show
They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed out wheelchair
Money comes and money goes but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years
DE FENSE
Why aren't they killing each other
I don't care about B.C. I care about M.E
Man how many quarters does this game take
Nice work son
I decide who reads and when
I said I'll take it
Wee
And to show you how this book works I will demonstrate on some rats
What did that guy say when I said Who's that guy
Somebody light this monkey
From now on you're my main man
Please
You won
Oopsie
Get that cat out of the way
Hail Flanders
Bo ring
Take a hike boss I'm running things now
Kids shouldn't have secrets
Can I take a walk
Watch the sprinkler
Amber tell her how I abandoned you
Woo hoo
I practically insist
It's so beautiful
Frankly I'd be a little turned on
Hmm
Are we in India yet
Speak for yourself
No but the rabbi gave me this
Look they killed the evil doll
The devil with his fly open
The only thing I've dug up was these weird looking mushrooms
I want to visit strange exotic malls
And with no brain damage amage amage amage amage amage
No
Go on
Marge you make it sound so seamy
Ooh bacon
Do many people watch the Super Bowl
Oh Lisa has excellent hearing
Is there a Super Bowl Bunny
No problem guys

I've got the prescription for you doctor another hot beef injection
I hate to rain on your parade lady but this is my grave
You're hangin with me tonight

You think Maude isn't dating in heaven
Once again sleeping at work has saved my marriage
Go S.U
Not at all sweetie
Oh I only wanted to show my school spirit
Hmm somebody's travelin light
Turn the television to what channel
Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave
Look out for the stairs
Here comes the bouncing ball of justice
Daddy would like a word with you Barty
Now the movie's turned into a play
I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs
Hyper Obesity
Why doesn't he need it
Much better
Mmm fattening
Generation awesome does it again
Marge
Son you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist
Got any junk that will go up in value after you die
You stay right here
Our first job is to entertain
I've got a class to teach
What are you dopes lookin at
Which he is
It's the twelve noon robot parade
Although wow
Pile in everybody
I'm the worst thing to happen to sports since Fox
It's the biggest tax increase in history
What's the longest anyone's ever done this
Flutter your wings
At long last
Okay spread your toes
Get it
Yeah well I still get to punish you
I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am
Uh I have a question Phoney
I mainly bought this house for the view
All expenses paid
The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers
What the hell is that
This Bozo's gonna walk me
Goodbye my darling
Well my son does
This is getting very abstract but thank you
And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near so I'm gonna work you like a dog
Ooo I'm sorry Moe
Great
No it's not that I'm afraid
No it's not
No I'm killing him first
Skeptical
You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude
Huh
Homer Simpson
I'm gonna be the best car thief ever
Hey
Duh der duh
Well I quit my job just like you said to
You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled
She had to identify a body at the morgue
Drink up my drink
Well it's like the time that your cat Snowball got run over
Hmmmm
I do
I'm sorry Marge
Come on I have a disgusting idea
Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins
Okey doke
Did that butter churn just move
Ow
C'mon
It's like we're at Cheers
That'll do it Apu
Ow
That's my motto
Governor I've been using my powers of snitching for evil
That's why I haven't done anything with my life
Stomp it
Marge I want you to admit you have a gambling problem
Well who wouldn't be upset
We're getting a new TV
There's only one thing I can do
Thank you sir may I have another
Point of order I didn't lose all the money
Thought you could get away huh
Aw this is a new low for me
Well at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation
Starting tomorrow no bread before dinner
You passed out before we could even give you your presents
Hey Ganesha want a peanut
I'm Mr. Burns
Maybe it's true
It's a trick
Oh come on
The thing is I lost creative control of the project
Time to take out the Euro trash
This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life
Oh guys it was horrible
Hey
Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day
Mmm extra virgin
This is a private sky box
Fine
Cut that racket
I think you've learned your lesson
Maybe I can sweat it out
I need help
This is just too weird
I want answers now or I want them eventually
But I didn't make a movie about it
Eat my dust mortals
We need to talk
For the love of God make sure the party boat has a moon bounce
You're just as bad as me
I hope you can find happiness without me
Oh by the way I was being sarcastic
It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives
Sorry honey
I'm so happy we're together again
Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath
Great
Try this
If you don't have a captain I could be that
I have to think like a great military leader
In all those years why didn't you ever try to contact me
Here you go Maggie
You have to cheat
I'm comfortable like this
No mas
I'll do it myself
Look at Shemp
But then I rode em again
I'm the luckiest man in the world now that Lou Gehrig's dead
You can't just kill off a classic TV character

Presenting my mother

The main thing is for you to get better
Fine
All right you're not a coward
That's one way
It's way better than whatever the alternative is
Uh yessir

Whoo hoo
In your face Bush

Broken lonely grownups

Flanders
So why don't you act your age forgive her and let me down
Sure they're on top of the world
