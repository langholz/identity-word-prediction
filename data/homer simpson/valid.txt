Let the agriculture begin
So anyway Mr. X would say Marge If this doesn't get your motor running my name isn't Homer J

Friends of Dan Marino

Yeah but I'm on a plane idiot
Boy they've got better things to talk about than you
Thinks he's so big cause he's got a lot of guns
No
The second I let go of the wheel this little wonder kicks in
Wait let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles
All right let's try the red one
It's not fair to compare us to an American household
Ever
Wha
Great plan Bart
That's exactly what I'm having
Or a highly paid internship
Yep
I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top solo
What is all this stuff
Ow
So anyhoo back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant
Remember Mystic Caverns
Let's see Apu's cousin is medium height dark complexion brown eyes black hair
I'd love to honey but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today
Just the monkey then
Or would I
Branch monster
That's not America
Quick pass me down
Hey look what I got
The more you rock the angrier I get
Goodnight Barney
Especially you Joey Kramer
Many childless advocates are like Ben Affleck famous successful people from out of State
My ears are burning
Aw I love this pedestrian mall
Lenny
Here we go
What advantages does this motorcar have over say a train
It works on so many levels
C'mon c'mon
It came out again
I miss my car so much everyone's driving but me
I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world
But please don't you say that word
The minute you become our landlord you expect us to pay rent
I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work
That's me
Patent pending
However
It was your mother
Yes I do
Whoa
Well
Hey sweetheart what's the matter
But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting
M E R
I want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing
Yes
Did I crush your corporation
It made me angry Jerry
Ow
Boy I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold
So many flavors
Haw haw loser
You're getting a cab old man
Then I must flee
Because he's making scones
See your eye is completely safe
Well someone's tucked in to an insane degree
That's it
Ah
You're going to bed without supper
Nooooooo
Leave me alone
Or possibly an ice cream headache
Oh
Marge I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram nesia
She does not want to turn out like you didn't not until diplomatic trapped help remember nothing
How can I help you
Ask your mother
I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows
I've got to apologize
What are you doing here Patty or Selma
get the snake
I think she's right
Oh it's even worse when you know it has a name
You know I think Milhouse is El Barto
So who won
Lisa come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am
Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets
Why are you doing that
Aw aren't they sweet
Marge won't dump me
Oh so forming an angry mob eh
I'm not a murderer I'm not
The only kind of pain a man can understand
Hmmm two bucks And it only transports matter
More
Shaving my shoulders I'm gettin it all shaved off
It's okay it's okay
Woo hoo
He didn't want to have me
One two Eh I'd rather die
Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word
Who the heck is that guy
I toileth not on ye Sabbath woman
Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge
You see
No
Woo
I love you Marge and I realize now I should show you more often
Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex
Now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory
To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson
But Marge Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban
AWDAMMIT
Deal
Look at me
I'll be there next Sunday
Look at Wait they misspelled Guitar Hero
I climbed the unclimbable mountain
Ooh la la
No wait three
Will I get to meet Dave
Oh I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life
He is not my boyfriend
Gee thanks Moe What's this
Oh yeah the costume
Wow nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks
Are you comin to bed
Ah geez
Lisa knock off that racket
Now if I fart that's cause I'm so relaxed
Yes it is
I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different
C'mon I want to see those legs all furry and gross
Whew
If you've got that then
Goodbye Mom
He's named like my name
Hey let's go out to dinner tomorrow
I hate that lousy dean
Oh
Must eat beef must defeat guy I just met
What am I going to do
How can you be so calm and cool
Okay Rod and Todd are and the wife has a thing for me but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility
Stay out of this Dad
Back and forth
But there's more
Grampa
I don't know how
What am I doing here
Let's roll
That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight
It's not sugar it's caramel
I know honey
Cordless drill
Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy
Exactly like Chandler always criticizing
Whups be careful of my tail
He was boarding a plane to Switzerland and Oh
Oh
No
All good points
Like all young people I had a musical dream
I could never do something like that
You know that racecar bed I made him
I mean Honey
Then I can just push him over
Keep using nuclear power
Just like a pencil company executive
Three
That's enough running
Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing
Ranier Wolfcastle
This is gonna be the best vacation ever or we all agree to disband and join other families
Do it for the normals
I can do this
Hey I hear ya buddy
Well I have to work but give the monitor a kiss
Aww Ohh you look like a little tiny dinosaur
Daddy
Oh he ain't gettin married
No
Uh well uh hm I just uh
Sometimes I go places
Now the cat knows
Ray would high five me
Now who's stupid
We didn't have a lot of money but we were young and in love
Oh Marge don't worry a lot of movie stars have gray hair like all those women we loved in the eighties
I tried to fill it with family religion community service
Shut up
Put it in
Excellente
Well I'd better get you home
I am so sick of that damn code
But you can't leave
Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain
When a man isn't a hero to his son he's nothing
I'm on my way
Fun Dad is a foodie now
I LOVE THE LEADER
Yo Apu gimme the usual
What
I'm done
Man that hurt
Take me
That made sense
I'm on the floor
No
Oh I wanted the black one
Now you got a law suit on your hands
Mrs. Simpson may I take you for an evening drive
Long hours no pay and at the end all you get is someone yelling you screwed me up
So did I son
Uh
Beer
What about my wife and kids
Don Rickles zinged you Marge
Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up
We can buy stuff we can't afford temporarily own the hell out of it and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund
What's your clearance
She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow
After a few practice trips here the real Kwik E Mart will be a piece of cake
Are they real or symbolic
Oh what if I said Well if you
You're right Marge
Woop sorry son
Now I'm over here
And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza
Well today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time
That's right
Okay
But come on you know what our vacations are like
Be right back
Third best for me
He's breathtaking but Bart has inner beauty like you'd find in a rodent
Pleased to meet you
Wait a minute
Half goes to my Vegas wife
You need something red
No these guys are geniuses
Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night
Perfect
Bart's not mad at me
Remember honey we're disobeying an unjust law here
Before I met you I had friends and dreams
Hey what smells so good
Hey boy check out my new car
Hey my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him
Fakey phony broad
But feel free to go nuts on me
Enough saxomophone already
And I want in
I'll field this one
No more chat rooms for you
She must be a hundred million years old
If you do I'll get you a new pony
Yeah but I usually have three or four
Woo hoo
I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail
Now you're talkin
She's gonna take him for a lot of money
Ain't it the truth
You kids have got to learn that actions have consequences
All these years I watched you turn our son into a time bomb and yet I did nothing
Well I couldn't have done it without Bart
Together
Mr. Burns he's okay
Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments
They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds
Ooh it's dinner time
Oh come on
Now we wait for the river to freeze
Save your breath
Do me
A genuine official police badge
Marge he's got to get over his fear of coffins
What if I undo this button
So it's gonna be like that eh
Hey this was supposed to be about me
Woo hoo
Family meeting
Okay book I didn't read you and you didn't read me but we're both in this together so say something smart or get ready to run like hell
Okay
A little fruit
Put a sock in it Roy
Oh good
Well that's very reasonable
I'd rather die
Really
There's no escape from the airport
Good luck Mr. Burns
I've got to return this keg
Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me
You gotta hit it just right
Mmmm hamburgers
He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel
But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path
Wait wait
Ooh she wants to know how your life is going
I'm the president and the decision is mine
See
Homer
Maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas
It's impossible
Wait
Must protect sugar Thieves everywhere
Woo hoo
Now how would that work
Now beat it
A baby shot a guy
I can't wait for the reviews
But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up
But how did he survive in the world of theater
I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik E Mart anymore
Except
Some of which happened in this very theater
He's smokin hot
I got on the kiss cam I participated in the wave and I got to pee in a trough
Noooooooo
Look at yourselves pointing guns at your fellow man
sleeping sweetly
There's a big difference
All right
Which I did
Don't worry honey the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy it'll make Moon River sound like a farting Orangutan
Promises were made
It's fun for the whole family
Hey kids uh you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you

WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN SOMETHING SOMETHING THEN YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE

You're the devil
But without beer prohibition doesn't work
Thank God

All I wanted was a second honeymoon and now the floor is made of lava
Wait a minute
You talk better than you fool
Oh my life is ruined

Oh nothing
After what you said to me I watched hours and hours of soccer
But Marge the Gilded Truffle is an intimate elegant place
Safe and sound
And I owe it all to Spring Break
Butt on bowl little man
It sickens me
And there's something else it might be good for
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry
Hey cut it out
I got it
That's your advice
Sorry son

Well it did its job
While I'm here I might as well pre punch out
