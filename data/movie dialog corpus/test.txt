I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio
Lady such a man As all the world why he's a man of wax
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back
For example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form
Who told you we deal drugs

Don't you threaten me
He learned his lessons quickly and left me
All right open your eyes
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape
It's not important

Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one
Okay

I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN
Yes it would have been criminal
Soiled with dirt foul sullen hostile forbidding as a black day
I heard ya lady is wild
