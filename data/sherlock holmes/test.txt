Why
Pillars and the screens
Inspector do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another City suicide
Happy New Year John
You're not safe in there
Two minutes would have made me an expert
Henry Knight he saw it too but you didn't John
What
Stop it
Didn't expect to see you here
Where's he been
Sir I think you'll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking
Than who
My name is Hello
Allow me to take it for you
So where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time
Don't be
I need to know what to do
Doesn't even know he's doing it
Mm hm
Well you know what I think
It's okay don't worry
Yes
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a hand gun
You'll forgive me for taking precautions
The case of the vanishing glow in the dark rabbit
Why are they
Hello brother dear
Yes
Oh he really can you know
The woman woman
No stop
Okay
Books
Oh no
Yes
I'm not a child any more Mycroft
These circus performers were gang members sent here to get it back
Happy families
Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff
I am dismissive of the virtuous unaware of the beautiful and uncomprehending in the face of the happy
Yes
What am I saying
Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing
You've been typing in a hurry probably
A French decathlete found completely out of his mind surrounded by one thousand eight hundred and twelve matchboxes all empty except this one
But where
On one condition
I'm sorry
U M Q R A wasn't it
I have a sudden need to use it
So the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex twenty years ago and left them behind
Play what
He's fast
Why would I do that
Mrs Monkford

Well you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well
Stop boring me and think
Identical triplets one in half a million births
A desanctified church
Trying to recruit you

Gunpowder treason and plot
Good morning brother mine
The cipher
I'd be very grateful
Molly I think I'm going to die
It's virtually undetectable
I'm your brother
Shut up
Conclusion someone broke in here and murdered him
Oh I wouldn't count on that
Maybe two ideas
No
Lots of different spices
Shut up John

Why would he mind
A substitute corpse bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti takes her place and is later transported to the morgue
John
credit card bills receipts
No
Good Samaritan
Consulting detective
No
No I
And it's the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk
You know me
No
Actually just Napoleon would do
Mmm nature
Why aren't you dead
I need to know how you escaped
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left
Superbly
No one else will die though and I believe they call that a result
Good
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard
Time you got out of the house John
It's an exchange not a gift
Don't mind if I do
but it's all computer generated electronic codes electronic ciphering methods
They all care so much
The setting's a shade melodramatic don't you think
No he wasn't really was he
No no of course I'm not okay
Next you can stop pointing that gun at me
You should be
Interesting
You picked it up from that table
Since the moment of conception
It's no use Frankland

When the two cars were examined the fake seat had melted in the fire revealing Charlie who'd been sitting there quite dead for a week
No I'm not
Okay my turn
The police don't consult amateurs
On painting yes
I have to filter out a lot of witless babble
You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you
I
That's mine
Surprise me
He said he liked trains
Don't solve the murder
This drug will then render the president entirely susceptible to the will of their new master none other than James Moriarty
Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle so
Have you met him before
After all he was in Tibet
When John first broached the subject of being best man I was confused
Coming
I've always been able to trust my senses the evidence of my own eyes until last night
You're wrong you know
Well the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres
Hold that cab
No I won't give you an interview no I don't want the money
Of what
Don't you want me on the floor too
She came to Baker Street
Indeed any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes in truth from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides
They'll be keeping a eye on the building
Oh you can have this back now
I delete any text that begins Hi

She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher and the cipher was the song
Brother mine don't appal me when I'm high

He gave the phone to you that says he wants you to stay in touch
Neither can you
John
One of your traders someone who worked in your office was killed
Hmm
It's quick
No
It wasn't my hat
Childhood trauma masked by an invented memory
Fancy some chips
Molly I just want you to do something very easy for me and not ask why
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it
I have reasons
It's not true is it
It's a warning
It won't happen again
Hardly worn
Clearly
By your skill set you are or were an intelligence agent
Mental note
Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists
Brilliant
The Mall please
An outside eye a second opinion
Get your hat and boots
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment
It'll take us weeks to find him again
Well not on my watch

There's our lift
Those are my specialisms
Nothing
John and I will take the windows you take the stairs
Anderson
That's very kind of you
You started out in manual labour
You killed my best friend
It must be you that he wants and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust
The bullet's still inside me
Yes fascinating irrelevant
Do your research
And there's a smudge of ink on your wrist and a bulge in your left jacket pocket
Your skirt
I could just walk out of here
Anything interesting
Why this particular Grenadier
North side of the island sir
Who's next
How do I have utility
Let him
He's um
That takes me back
Eurus is in control
Welcome to London
How wonderful
It's not what they saw it's what they both brought back in those suitcases
God

So here in front of you all my first and last vow
He's got a wife in Doncaster that nobody knows about
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy
I see you've got a new boyfriend Molly and you're serious about him
Good
Now why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant
Did she eat it
This is your heart and you should never let it rule your head
It must be on her desk
Not a patch on Connie Prince
I sent them a message
You're a medical man
Was there a suitcase in this house
Of course she was writing Rachel no other word it can be
So what if he's right
Thatcher present at the first break in
The bride's face
Fortunately I haven't been idle
Say that again

But there's a photograph of children
That's the whole of it if you're looking for baby names
What's he been feeding you
Won't you sit
Just giving it a go
Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary
Why don't we go and find out
Seb
Bring it to the Tramway their London hideout
I see you've written up the taxi driver case
She's literally taken over the asylum
Please

Some silence right now would be marvellous
Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding
There wasn't anything physical going on was there
No
Some people who aren't geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others
You want help
Yeah
So what do they do
I fear Scotland Yard has reached a new low
Yes
Is it nice not being me
I've been asked to negotiate the return of those letters
Isn't it hateful
Quickly where

So sorry
Fair play
Why d'you think I know what to do

His personal effects will have been impounded
There's something something something I'm missing something staring me in the face
You are amazing

What he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise
You are
Not tougher than crystallised carbon
No no no
Shot in the dark
Thank you
You repel me
I got it from Bart's morgue
set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
Nothing made me
Please
Tell us where you are
Mission accomplished for the terrorists

Arrived from China four days ago

Hansel and Gretel
Mid #s at a guess
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions '
Try as long as possible not to drown
Vendor doesn't give his name
Bad news for brain work
What else
If we find it we can use it beat Moriarty at his own game
Think it through next time
Quite so
They said her name
Rhododendron ponticum
Just that
No
Low self esteem tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy and you think he's an audacious criminal mastermind
Do people actually read your blog
Not just agents
And you think you're the girl for that job do you
plaster bust
Who came to my flat
Tie pin
You don't have long though
No
He bought you a present
I'm I'm nice ish clever important to some people but I tend to rub them up the wrong way
Handy really as your ever expanding backside is permanently glued to it

Can you hear us
And I assume she scrubbed your floors going by the state of her knees
You're gonna be all right
The loos please

Eddie Van Coon was the thief
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom

Are you gonna help us or not
Nuh three
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug
Ah no
Lilac
I meant it
I don't understand
This time should anyone attempt to identify her it would be positively absolutely her
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside
This is beautiful
You came through the kitchen door saw the state of that floor scrubbed to within an inch of its life
She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married
Course you don't
I killed his wife
How would you know
What happened
Okay
Let's go for a walk
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go '
No no no it was more than that John
I don't know
No no no your exact words
Right you two
Names aren't one word
Oh let me guess
Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died
Intelligence planning
Can you walk
You have I estimate twenty minutes left
Brilliant
On reflection it probably wasn't a very good choice of gift
That way his view was blocked by the ambulance station
It's been five minutes since Mycroft called
No one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone
Yyyes
As does lethal injection
Mmm
This is clearly a man's work
What happened
Um try try to stay calm
I'm changing my bet to three years four months and eleven days
Who's that then
Very good John
I'm so sorry Major
When finally I understood I expressed to him that I was both flattered and surprised
Don't be shy
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt out remains of the car
Right yes
How was it
Yes
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with
The Incident of the Mysterious Mrs Ricoletti the Killer from Beyond the Grave has been widely reported in the popular press
Good luck and best wishes Mike Stamford
Tell him there's an escaped rabbit
Of course
Doctor Watson will take the room upstairs
Because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets
Kill us both and leave
He has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious which borders on mania
Mine's like an engine racing out of control a rocket tearing itself to pieces trapped on the launch pad
I think it could work
Yes or
How breathtakingly prescient of her
I'm gasping
Friend of mine
It's why we came here
I am finding you
The thrill of the chase the blood pumping through your veins just the two of us against the rest of the world
That one I think
Why was I screaming
It was immense had burning red eyes and it was glowing John
I didn't order a taxi
Just here please
I saved Molly Hooper
I'll get some
It's entirely possible she's in danger
I prefer my doctors clean shaven
The thought had occurred
You assumed it was just wedding nerves
Victor
Our rat's just come out of his den
What is it
How can John be having a birthday dinner
I've managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information
I need to question her
But you can see me
The only reason he's still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there
How could he survive
If Moriarty wanted the Jewels he'd have them
Which is why you can't resist
Do we really need so much colour
Um
Oh not just planned
Nope
John
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako
Moriarty
Tragic accident
And down again
What
Oh just passing the time
Come to me
The woman
Sorry
My thoughts precisely
You may need to re start my heart on the way
I
Why is it always the hat photograph
He's trying to make it easy for me to kill him
No you don't
Closer
Yes
Door locked from the inside
They tend to be social outcasts educationally sub normal
Major Sholto
Did he have any connection with Thatcher
One two three der der der Ahh pretty good
How did you know his middle name
It seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the Earth
So
No
You suspended the signs
Can you turn this off
Major Sholto no one's coming to kill you
But tell me why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad
His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street
It's all I've got
The time was right but the date was wrong
Please just say it
I was immersed
That creature that rotting thing is a living breathing coagulation of human evil and if the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it then my life will not have been wasted
I just did
Because you're an idiot
I thought that might include you
Where
There are two types of fans
Of course
Pointless
You might get a reply but I doubt it
All emotions and in particular love stand opposed to the pure cold reason I hold above all things
The heart medication you are taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia
She never leaves her phone at home
It as all the qualities of the old with some of the colour of the new
His body would have gone on for ages if the train hadn't met a stretch of track that curved
Please tell me which idiot did this
Yeah well I've got a friend with me so
Excellent plan with intelligent precautions
Just you and me
They're numbers
We can do this
She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead
Let's go
Rich Brook in German is Reichen Bach the case that made my name
All the living classmates check out spotless
Scented hand soap in his apartment
You
Help me bring him down
Right then
The conclusion seemed inescapable
Howard's a lifelong drunk
Oh yes
I'm doing well
It's a fake
Go to your right
No no
Finally
Botox is a diluted form of botulinum
Congratulations
Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house this ghost however is willing to commute look
Slow but lucky very lucky
You've put on weight
It's highly unlikely that a left handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head
We
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death originating in America
What
Right here right now what is she
I reckon we've got about twenty minutes before they realise something's wrong
I should say I I've meant to say always and then never have
Young Sherlock Good boy
I think from now on we'll downgrade you to casual acquaintance
What
Right
not be myself
Mmm not interested
Try not to start a war before I get home
It was all totally scientific laboratory conditions well literally
How do you know about that
Yes
How reassuring
This kid will die
Get me some morphine from your kitchen
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument
I've been an idiot a blind idiot
How's the diet
Why didn't you intervene sooner
It only encourages you
A chemical minefield
Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding
The painting is a fake
Who is this
Stay here
Twice
Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him
In a bit
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood and thus her apparent suicide is witnessed by the frightened crowd below
On my desk there's a number
Almost certainly money
He's romancing his way up a pecking order somebody's pecking order
Got my eye on a nice little place in central London
Don't say anything
Thank you
Scrubbed them clean whitened them where they got discoloured
The number on my desk
However many happy returns
Are you two having a little joke
It was revenge
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd '
But a word to the wise should any of you require the services of either of us I will solve your murder but it takes John Watson to save your life
I know what happened to Redbeard
Ex con
Redbeard
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about
Don't let her distract you
Oh but I will have the camera phone though
She's obviously unconsciously retaining saliva
No the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination but I'm sure he'd make a pretty decent job of your boiler
Obvious really
You can take some of the credit
Stepfather posing as online boyfriend
Well you're typing a lot
Thank you very much for your time Mr Ewert
Give me time
Sorry what
Mmm
Was that supposed to happen the light going down
Not worth my time
Sounds like a good place to start
That's right
You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter
How much more revenge are you gonna need
Can I have a cup of tea
Why were they painted
Why
Showing off
Yes but it wasn't a burglar
He missed a whole Wednesday once didn't have a clue
They'll get in the way
Smoking indoors isn't there one of those one of those law things
Is that what
Oh yeah of course
That you're a dead man walking
Stop there
Same old Ian not a care in the world
Yes but it's definitely him that he talks about
It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins
Off it
Why would an agent give his life to tell us something incredibly insignificant
We would never do that to John Watson
Exactly when he showed us the letters
He's still here
Yes hello
Threatened me with a knighthood again
Yes
There's shaving foam behind your left ear
The most dangerous man you've ever met and not my problem right now
Coming
Apologies about my you know thing
You know about this don't you
Odd though he hasn't been in touch
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit
Houston we have a mistake
Ah the wall had it coming
You were threatening to kill them
Estranged father
If it makes you feel better
I think you know why I'm here Phillip
But then how did
Will caring about them help save them
You have a what
He was a bad cabbie
It wasn't me that upset her Mycroft
What if it is individual letters
You said he was anxious
What dull lives they must lead
No one's been in that flat for at least three days
Didn't want to lug a package up the escalator
Afraid
Oh clever boy
People will wonder what we're talking about
You think of your children but you don't get to see them
Yes
What An Anderson what are you doing here on a drugs bust
That's what I was suggesting
Yep
The first scenario involved hurling myself into a parked hospital van filled with washing bags
Hey
There was only a voice on the phone remember and a code word
Try looking yourself
Now that is a dominatrix
Why should I
But no he wanted rid of it
Shoulder
And you're clearly acclimatised to never getting to the end of a sentence
Check the rest of the house
You saw what you were supposed to see
And then I sat back and watched Moriarty destroy my reputation bit by bit
Trust me on that I should know
Wouldn't be fun if I knew
The pirate
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street
Love what
It's been an age
Will you two please keep it down
We'll follow later
Sorry about that
Thank you
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper I must remind you that one false move with your finger and you will be dead
Like a gaze from a crowd of strangers suddenly one is aware of staring into ze face of an old friend
You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee
Wouldn't he
Oh I wasn't being critical
Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel
When I happened on you and Magnussen you had a problem
Talk about what
I know what happened to your son
Many unexpected skills required in the field of criminal investigation
The the the corpse is is six months old it's dressed in a shoddy Victorian outfit from a museum
So that leaves us with Alex
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired from his gun
Yes and I need to get back there
Human
Who's this one
Show me the rest of her
There's a row thirteen which eliminates the more superstitious airlines
I want you to send a text
