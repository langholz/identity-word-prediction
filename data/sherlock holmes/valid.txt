I have an international reputation
Yes yes yes yes YES
So you're a proper genius too
Is
Molly
Well you know they've had their ups and downs
Ah that's why he's bouncing round him like a puppy
John
This was alight moments ago
It's okay
Someone's been redecorating
The shade of red echoes her lipstick either an unconscious association or one that she's deliberately trying to encourage
I will be monitoring
Come on play fair
Was I right
Password password password
It's it's a sort of experiment
And admirably high arches
Oh that's good
Is he on his way
The killer must have been interrupted otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely
But as I'm apparently your best friend I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion
He'd stood there for hours plenty of people watching nothing apparently wrong
How can you be alive
I need you to maximise your visual memory
Really
Without your love Save My soul seek my room
Where are you
Home Office
Got the real thing
An apple
Let's play Murder
I need to go to my mind palace
Can I borrow your phone
Thanks Greg
Made of vinyl two different types of vinyl present
It's Sunday morning so it's closed
Well I'm sorry about that
That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair
I have been many things John but when have I ever been a malingerer
What is it
Oh John calm down
But he won't be there
Sorry
I knew Moriarty made plans
Oh congratulations by the way
Yeah I'm fine I'm fine
That narrows the field considerably
So's Sergeant Donovan
Stop it
Did you bring your revolver
That's a shame
Mr Magnussen am I acceptable to you as an intermediary
Four
Well you could try
I'll need some equipment of course
Find Rachel
The English woman
Because he was delivering something heavy
You're quite right
Client left this while I was out
You're to give me twenty four hours
Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance
I use my senses John unlike some people so you see I am fine in fact I've never been better so just Leave
He's selling it the programme he used to break into the Tower
L.A. Santa Monica
Bout an hour ago
She's my landlady
Coming
I've run out
Don't move don't speak don't breathe
Get off
It's a story my brother told me when we were kids
You said your life turned on one word
You knew about the wedding more importantly you'd seen a wedding invitation
I remember Redbeard
Not a problem
So what's this one
No no no Mr Berwick not at all
No
Of course he's dead
Why would he do that
I do
Open and shut domestic murder
Toilets
Literally
Don't tell me you abandoned your post
Eurus Help me save John Watson
What did you say
Told you I made a promise a vow
It's what I do
About me
Hello Redbeard
We had chips
Why
Oh
Nicotine patches remember
Well we'll see about a refund
St James the Less
All his friends hate him
Need to work on your half of the church Mary
And you really thought he was the one didn't you
Sit down Mr Knight and do please smoke
I was waiting until we got married
That woman Tessa
It's a drone
Well it's what he believes
Of the body
I I never knew you cared
When have I ever been that
So you risked your life four times just to kill strangers
John
Please
Any moment now something's gonna happen
A drug of course
You're abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you've fallen in love with conforms to that pattern
Can you go to the front of the plane
Look around you
Well they're not actually telegrams
Anderson won't work with me
What
Doctor Watson is endlessly vigilant
Janine
Thank you yes
Clostridium botulinum
Interesting yes
We've got ourselves a serial killer
A name can't be one word
Now John I'd poison
Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen
No
What time is it
Putting on weight again
Need something more specific
No no no no
You need to wear one of these
So
You assumed she reacted like that because I was her kidnapper
What else does she have
Mycroft's intelligence it's not nebulous at all
I'm sorry
What do you make of it
Tell me what you remember
A Parker Duofold iridium nib
No she was leaving an angry note in German
Mr Baker
It's not important
John
Actually um that was mostly Mycroft's idea
Nobody would have been looking for it
They didn't come here to kill me they have to keep me alive
I've got some shopping to do
Going into battle John
Down girl
Borgia Pearl boring go
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this
If you miss the bullet will ricochet
Have you got a theory
Oh good
No
Yeah but to be fair you work with murder victims
No lead there
But the rhythm
They won't work with me
Safest place to hide
Everything's gonna be all right
That was a mistake
What's that
I condemn Alex Garrideb
Don't worry
Oh I don't do the arresting
Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog John real life is rarely so neat
It's also the name of an assassin real name Oskar Dzundza one of the deadliest assassins in the world
There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside
Well that's suggestive
Tell me about the seats
Ultimately for full satisfaction it requires plain sight
It's not too late
Oh and the name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is two hundred and twenty one B Baker Street
Fan sites indispensible for gossip
Now where were we
Yeah I went to see about a job at that surgery
You want me to prove it yes
Sorry
I've just told you that the Western world is run from this house and you want to talk about dinner
She's got a man's wedding ring on a chain round her neck clearly her late husband's and too big for her finger
His therapist
Ignore me
Caught the murderer still looking for the legs
Because of your idiot stories
One half of the human race at war with the other
Um sorry to disturb you
And you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word so that happened I don't doubt it but how can that word be a name a name you instantly recognised that tore your world apart
Work is the best antidote to sorrow Mrs Hudson
That's why all those assassins tried to save my life
Well I can't see it can I
And you just walk your victims in
Looks like it
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty
Uh wh wh wh what did you call that one John
How's Sarah John
Not interested
I hate the titles
I'm a private detective
Somehow this is about your children
But those are only the ones we catch
It's murder all of them
Donovan
Look at the houses
That's how he got in
Controlled usage is not usually fatal and abstinence is not immortality
It's a text alert
It's the gap
I need your answer Mycroft as a matter of urgency
No they're not
You
I don't know who you are
So you're doing well
This is their only way out
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth while actually firing the other into the ground
Stroke of luck meeting her at your wedding
Your phone
Mm hmm
Waterloo Bridge
John
Four floors up
What people say
Get out
Come on
I was only a kid myself
Move
Dewer's Hollow now
He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building jumped the balcony to kill Van Coon
It'll be in an odd phrase in an online blog or an unexpected trip to the countryside or a misplaced Lonely Hearts ad
Taxi
You should you know
solve crimes
Claire de la lune
I I I've miscalculated
Keep your eyes fixed on me
It's nothing to do with footprints
Her suitcase yes obviously
Open her up
We're going to jump in front of that bus
Absolutely no idea but What the hell are you doing here
Have a good time
My respects
John
Lovely little village
It's boring
It's an ear hat John
There's only one bullet left
Type and send it
You mean I'd make a great feature Sherlock Holmes the man beneath the hat
Fetch it for me if you wouldn't mind
This is brilliant
Moriarty's not mounting any defence
Good idea
That's why you've come
It was you
Where's the weapon
It's for our benefit
What's she doing
You want to go out on a case
Crime scene
Who from
I'm not in shock
Possibly
Kickback from a gun with this calibre would be massive
He was waiting for the killer
After all not all the men you fall for can turn out to be sociopaths
I am you prepared to do anything prepared to burn prepared to do what ordinary people won't do
Drearcliff House
Admit it
Well I noticed one on the way in and I haven't got any change
Wanna see some more
Have you come to take me away again
To Mr and Mrs Watson
Shh John concentrate
Bored
Lord Moran vanishes
The boot was mean
Colleague of mine Doctor Watson
What big day
You're suicidal
Blood loss
For the past few months it's been on open display on a wall
I don't want everyone knowing I'm still alive
Congratulations by the way
Is that it
Don't take off your belt
John
Can't everyone do that
Only lies have detail
Keeps doing that
I think he wants me to take a look
It's like a great cesspool into which all kinds of criminals agents and drifters are irresistibly drained
That's the frailty of genius it needs an audience
What progress have you made
Just my parents
Do you see
John or the dog
Not really your best line of enquiry
So you've had another one of your little meetings
It's the first proper lead that we've had
Where did the taxi drop you
Look at the case
Can't do it not now
Why not
She was dying
Re
Either way Miss Hooper has lurrrve on her mind
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape
Can you tell me where he was
What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously
We're looking for a killer who can climb who can shin up a rope
The sugar yes
Forgive me please
And if she deviated by one word the sniper would set her off
To clarify Appledore's vaults only exist in your mind nowhere else just there
Yes
Oh let me guess I get killed
What's the trigger response time
eight minutes
Look at her hair
Oh and you think I've just got How To Defuse A Bomb tucked away in there somewhere
Don't get that splash pattern any other way
This is really very promising
Yeah no I'm I'm still here
You don't think I'd give up on a case like this just to spite my brother do you
You make your confession to them
Pretty damned smart
The Speckled Blonde
You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door but they're on the left hand side so you weren't driving you were in the passenger seat
Come on
I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter
Lady Carmichael's case what is it
He had his left arm cradled about her neck
Well
Actually I've just locked my keys in my flat
What
I I
I'm worried about you Molly
Well he has a very distinctive look
It's my city I know the turf
I
Show me where the brother slept
You can trust me
Because of what happened last night
And of course that's how he got into the bank
Help succour me now
Is it
Lambeth
Where are you taking her
How d'you mean
Please please please can you help
The East Wind this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path
Between us we've managed to botch this whole case
I didn't mention she was a woman
So he made his plan and rehearsed the murder making sure of every last detail
Hmm
Hardly a difficult deduction
No
A bit
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires they're notoriously difficult to schedule
Not once it's made a home there
Must have been a tightly packed shelf going by the severity of the crease
I was
You're kidnapped and nearly burned to death at a fireworks par What's the date John today's date
When I say run run
Where's the cottage
Now and then yes
No chance to smoke one on the train no time to roll one before you got a cab here
So a child with big feet gets Oh
Okay
Deeply hugely
What what am I
Really strange that he hired a car
Oh it'll pass
Is this a new person
Wait
You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you're consulting a detective
Thirty seconds
Oh well try to
Your MOD man
Thank you
You think it was the cat
I tried shouting but she didn't hear
Nothing
People do sentiment
This whole thing's verging on OCD
Morning
I need a case
Oh
How could I say no
He must stay exactly where he is
Even has a spray tan
There's an Off switch
A rabbit John
The who the what the why the when the where
What's this
On their way
And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic quite correctly I'm afraid
I'm on the rooftop
No he's always walked like that
Keep walking
You're very calm
I've told you he practically is the British government
One murder ten suspects
The oil in the kidnapper's footprint it'll lead us to Moriarty
What a wasted opportunity
Conclusion I have a sister
People say there's no such thing as coincidence
Til then basically
First get rid of your boys
You go
There's no message
Get down John
Mary Watson
Fine
South Bank somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo
Oh hi Mary
What a shame
You're not her
It's um very affirming
Vienna
Simple enough these days
He planted that doubt in her head that little nagging sensation
So we know that Doctor Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals
Well
I thought we were just hanging out
Goodbye Mr Holmes
It matches everything
You'll do
Stapleton
Heroes don't exist and if they did I wouldn't be one of them
No need to worry on that score Watson
Oh you most certainly are free and I suggest you remain that way
So you see Watson Mycroft was right
Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that
Delayed action stabbing
Gay
It's clever very clever
Took me less than a minute to guess yours
Not bad
Excellent
Two people who currently live together are about to attend church have a party go on a short holiday and then carry on living together
and then you left the way you came
I'm sorry
I said no
Miss Mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now
I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage
What's that noise
Owes me a favour
No it was me
Yes obviously
I don't like not knowing
I don't know the code
I fear she's branched into literary criticism by means of satire
I was invited
Myself
We agreed
You're desperate
Punch me in the face
Don't know what's got into the criminal classes
We played pirates
Forget about your court date
And what they did to others
Look at the jumper he's wearing
I couldn't find anything
Because the one person he thought didn't matter at all to me was the one person that mattered the most
However I'm not just here to praise John I'm also here to embarrass him so let's move on to some
It's more than possible
Why are you talking like this
There was something else a detail a code word
Oh
I think we're done now John
Never really comes up in crime work but um you know I live in hope of the right case
I checked
Anyone up for a trudge
Craig's got a dog
Mary when I say you deserve this man it is the highest compliment of which I am capable
Where exactly did they come from
Of what
What for
But if I do this
They're dogs bones
Of course not
Oh I see
That's her
I knew you'd talk to the people no one else would bother with
Why not
The regulation tread is unmistakeable lighter than Jones heavier than Gregson
Ah right yes
That is easily got
The conspirators had someone on the inside
But look you see body's betraying me
I'm sorry
Turn that off
He's OCD
Just tell me when to cough
I saw you take it
It's been here since Monday
Trouble is I couldn't remember what they were
You still smoke like a beginner
Mm hm
Why don't we have a chat
Oh for God's sake
Why would anyone mind
How could you survive
Check for the dates
What does it need a title for
It'll give you a chance to say goodbye
Is that really the best you can do
Me
Yep
Now quickly tell me
She's got a West Highland terrier called Whisky
What about us
Where is she
Pen and paper on the left hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left
No I got me out
I'm remembering the governor
Not just that ten individual e cigarettes
No that would just make them stupid or wrong
Exactly
Ah well
Gas leak yes
They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in
I really am a very busy man
Solved it without leaving the flat
Depends who owned it
I've solved it
You blew your own brains out
Each of them were rigorously worked out and given a code name
Why are you joking
It's a smartphone it's got GPS which means if you lose it you can locate it online
Now if you'll excuse me I have a hanging in Wandsworth and I'd hate them to start without me
You only ever see the camera
If they start to move I'll know something's up like rats deserting a sinking ship
This night you will die
I know exactly what he's going to do next
Twenty two Northumberland Street
It wasn't the cat
She must have given it to him recently this model's only six months old
And the hiker's taking a moment looking at the sky
Everything else is perfectly ordered managed
Impossible
You heard me perfectly
Oh they can keep an eye out
It was me playing
It's still here but it's just a dog
I asked on the phone
Then correct me Doctor
It's this way isn't it
How
Look at it Henry
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days
It was awful
Probably my answer has crossed yours
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
You've got the rest of your life
I can't spare the time
Perfectly sound analysis but I was hoping you'd go deeper
Hardly anyone notices
Oh
I know but your face
Well that was tedious
Could you wheel them out again for me
The Mayfly Man is
I am calm
You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions
Always rely on John to send me the relevant data as he never understands a word of it himself
I checked
We have all been drugged
I'm busy
Stay in here Watson
Seven are married and two are having an affair with each other it would seem
Those markings
The photograph's old but the frame's new
You can't set a trap without bait
Conclusion three you are terrified of her
Damn
What is she
So any more questions
What life
Don't stare
Off you go
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street
Um hey
Alex
How did you do that
Moran didn't disappear the entire Tube compartment did
This is my brother Mycroft
What did you see
That's what the graffiti meant
Fine
What's happening
Watch him
Just a magic trick
I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly
People don't really go to heaven when they die
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful but perhaps such things could come to pass
Is that good
The Spider
That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic
Yes yes yes and this I presume will be their coffin
And you've stolen another voice I presume
No I understand but where did you come from
What is it
I don't know
West wasn't killed here that's why there was so little blood
Oh I've been too slow
Cake
Baskerville ever heard of it
Oh hello
Or are you working for someone else
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it
Come on come on there is actually an element of Q and A to all of this
Text yes
I invented Moriarty
It's all about the blood
I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory
You think so
Page fifteen entry one Dead man
Well if you'd been listening you'd know she didn't
There'll be more of them
An instruction to all their London operatives
So we go round the Sun
Because it's never twins
That's why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed
Well you're the one who moved out
A wedding is in my considered opinion nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world
Sit down
Did you er get anywhere with that Morse code
Just moved in
The house sleeps
It was nothing to do with you
You were there and Mycroft
I need the right armour
What was my excuse again
There was no phone on the body there's no phone in the case
Pollen
It is nothing to be ashamed of
Four hundred and forty three point seven millilitres
It's Greek isn't it
Five times
Something's wrong
I know that now
Not that again
He's been in the river a long while
How often are you away
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street
Well thank you all for a fascinating case
Thank you
I'm sure the shop on the corner is open
Yes
I'll let you in on something Janine
I prefer to text
Trust me though she's not right for you
Do it
Seven so far
I ensured it
Mary
Those symbols at the bank the graffiti
Traders come to work at all hours
You sat there and watched me being beaten to a pulp
You don't need one do you living in isolation no human contact no visitors
Ooh God
We need to ask about the dusting
You have to wait for them to make a mistake
No
If you're that skilful you don't need an interview
So the killer goes to the bank leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon Van Coon panics returns to his apartment locks himself in
Exactly
Plain sight
Looking a bit thin
ask about the journalist
You have to leave her alone
There you are solved
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao
There's an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help
No it isn't
Eight
Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I
Keep your hands off it do you hear me
I need you to help me
Bricks from the #s
Absolutely
But you can't do this again can you
Yes then I disinfect myself
Why didn't he smash all the others
Charles Augustus Magnussen
He clings to the walls like an insect
That's Redbeard
There has to be a drug a hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind
What the hell is that
Hmm nice
If one of them starts acting suspiciously we know something's up
I even know you didn't make it home last night
According to one of her staff Raoul de Santos she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden
Hmm
I only saw him the other day
Wrong
What are you thinking pork or the pasta
Isn't there
Must be
What if you were rich and powerful and necessary
People do little else
I just wondered how things were going and and if there was anything I could do
Good
Since the start
You don't understand
Okay everybody just dance
Which in this case is a considerable advantage
In a manner of speaking
Never can
It's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street
How would you describe me John
Quickly
Do you think they give them classes
Sherlock is actually a girl's name
Moriarty in turn gave us hints just hints as to the extent of his web
And what about John Watson
But it doesn't read as the wrong card now
Hello
It's a story probably not true
Thank you
That's good
You what
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention
Thank you so much
Do not hang up
Oh
Exactly weeks
Your go
So she decided to make her death count
Thank you
Four women in four nights
Goodness knows what you'd get up to
We're here
Clearly
I love you
Still wanna make an appointment
Because dead men get listened to
Exactly
But why didn't he close the window when he left
Strange choice of words archaic
Far too busy
A hundred percent
He must have something special
What's that
The only question is how did the tetanus enter the dead woman's system
You can put back anything but dust
Carrying Andrew West way away from here
It's me
Then it's time to add a splash of colour
This is your father's favourite room
Always in pairs John
I made coffee
Where are we
Oh yes
British made twenty years old
No wait shh
Which is it today morphine or cocaine
Look not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death my death and now I'm back in a nice warm office with my big brother and Are those ginger nuts
Handbag
No stay exactly where you are
