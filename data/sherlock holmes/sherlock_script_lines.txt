How fresh? 
Fine. We'll start with the riding crop. 
I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me. 
Are you wearing lipstick? You weren't wearing lipstick before. 
Sorry, you were saying? 
Black, two sugars, please. I'll be upstairs. 
Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine. 
I prefer to text. 
Oh. Thank you. 
Afghanistan or Iraq? 
Which was it - Afghanistan or Iraq? 
Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you. What happened to the lipstick? 
Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now. 
How do you feel about the violin? 
I play the violin when I'm thinking. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other. 
I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't that difficult a leap. 
Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it. We'll meet there tomorrow evening; seven o'clock. Sorry - gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary. 
Is that what? 
Problem? 
I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him - possibly because he's an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic - quite correctly, I'm afraid. That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is two two one B Baker Street. Afternoon. 
Hello. Thank you. 
Sherlock, please. 
Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out. 
Oh no. I ensured it. 
Mrs Hudson, Doctor John Watson. 
Shall we? 
Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely. So I went straight ahead and moved in. 
Well, obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit. 
Friend of mine. When I say 'friend' ... 
Anything interesting? 
What did you think? 
Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone. 
Four. There's been a fourth. And there's something different this time. 
Where? 
What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different. 
Yeah. 
Who's on forensics? 
Anderson won't work with me. 
I need an assistant. 
Not in a police car. I'll be right behind. 
Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas! Mrs Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food. 
Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Don't wait up! 
You're a doctor. In fact you're an Army doctor. 
Any good? 
Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths. 
Bit of trouble too, I bet. 
Wanna see some more? 
Impossible suicides? Four of them? There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on! 
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on! Taxi! 
Okay, you've got questions. 
Crime scene. Next? 
What do you think? 
But? 
I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job. 
It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me. 
When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, "Afghanistan or Iraq?" You looked surprised. 
I didn't know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. But your conversation as you entered the room ... 
... said trained at Bart's, so Army doctor - obvious. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You've been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp's really bad when you walk but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq. 
You've got a psychosomatic limp - of course you've got a therapist. Then there's your brother. 
Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you're looking for a flatshare - you wouldn't waste money on this. It's a gift, then. Scratches. Not one, many over time. It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. Next bit's easy. You know it already. 
Harry Watson: clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who's Clara? Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently - this model's only six months old. Marriage in trouble then - six months on he's just given it away. If she'd left him, he would have kept it. People do - sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You're looking for cheap accommodation, but you're not going to your brother for help: that says you've got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don't like his drinking. 
Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man's phone; never see a drunk's without them. There you go, you see - you were right. 
The police don't consult amateurs. 
Do you think so? 
That's not what people normally say. 
'Piss off'! 
Did I get anything wrong? 
Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything. 
Harry's your sister. 
Sister! 
There's always something. 
I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade. 
I was invited. 
I think he wants me to take a look. 
Always, Sally. I even know you didn't make it home last night. 
Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson. Doctor Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. Old friend. 
No. 
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again. 
Quite clear. And is your wife away for long? 
Your deodorant told me that. 
It's for men. 
So's Sergeant Donovan. Ooh, and I think it just vaporised. May I go in? 
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over. And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees. You need to wear one of these. 
He's with me. 
I said he's with me. 
So where are we? 
May need longer.
Shut up.
You were thinking. It's annoying.
Not much.
Yes, thank you for your input.
Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night ... before returning home to Cardiff. So far, so obvious.
Doctor Watson, what do you think?
Of the body. You're a medical man.
They won't work with me.
Yes ... because you need me.
Doctor Watson.
Well?
Helping me make a point.
Yeah, well, this is more fun.
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.
You know what it was. You've read the papers.
Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes; I'm guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. Travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It's obvious from the size of her suitcase.
Suitcase, yes. She's been married at least ten years, but not happily. She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.
Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside - that means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It's not for work; look at her nails. She doesn't work with her hands, so what or rather who does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover; she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple.
It's obvious, isn't it?
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring. Her coat: it's slightly damp. She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it's dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so she must have come a decent distance but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff.
D'you know you do that out loud?
No, it's ... fine.
Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.
No, she was leaving an angry note in German(!) Of course she was writing Rachel; no other word it can be. Question is: why did she wait until she was dying to write it?
Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don't get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night. Now, where is it? What have you done with it?
Say that again.
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?
But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs. Even you lot couldn't miss them.
It's murder, all of them. I don't know how, but they're not suicides, they're killings - serial killings. We've got ourselves a serial killer. I love those. There's always something to look forward to.
Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it?(!) Someone else was here, and they took her case. So the killer must have driven her here; forgot the case was in the car.
No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking ... Oh. Oh!
Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.
Oh, we're done waiting! Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff: find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were. Find Rachel!
PINK!
Nicotine patch. Helps me think. Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.
Oh, breathing. Breathing's boring.
It's a three-patch problem.
Oh, yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?
Don't wanna use mine. Always a chance that the number will be recognised. It's on the website.
Yeah, she's downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
There was no hurry.
Her case.
Her suitcase, yes, obviously. The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake.
It's no use, there's no other way. We'll have to risk it. On my desk there's a number. I want you to send a text.
Text, yes. The number on my desk. What's wrong?
A friend?
Oh. Which one?
Did he offer you money to spy on me?
Did you take it?
Pity. We could have split the fee. Think it through next time.
The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now. On my desk, the number.
Yes. That's not important. Just enter the number. Are you doing it?
Have you done it?
These words exactly: "What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come."
What? No. No! Type and send it. Quickly. Have you sent it?
Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Hurry up!
Yes, obviously. Oh, perhaps I should mention: I didn't kill her.
Why not? Given the text I just had you send and the fact that I have her case, it's a perfectly logical assumption.
Now and then, yes.
By looking.
The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention - particularly a man, which is statistically more likely - so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it. Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens ... and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed. Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.
Well, it had to be pink, obviously.
Because you're an idiot. No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is. Now, look. Do you see what's missing?
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case. We know she had one - that's her number there; you just texted it.
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it. She never leaves her phone at home.
Well, the question is: where is her phone now?
Yes, or ...?
Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.
A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer ... would panic.
Four people are dead. There isn't time to talk to the police.
Mrs Hudson took my skull.
Relax, you're doing fine. Well?
Well, you could just sit there and watch telly.
I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so ... Problem?
What about her?
And I said "dangerous," and here you are.
Northumberland Street's a five-minute walk from here.
No - I think he's brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They're always so desperate to get caught.
Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That's the frailty of genius, it needs an audience.
This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go. Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?
Haven't the faintest. Hungry? Thank you, Billy. Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Keep your eyes on it.
He has killed four people.
Do you want to eat?
This is Angelo. Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.
I cleared it a bit. Anything happening opposite?
You did go to prison.
You may as well eat. We might have a long wait.
I'm sorry?
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.
What do real people have, then, in their 'real lives'?
Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.
I know it's fine.
No.
John, um ... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I'm flattered by your interest, I'm really not looking for any ...
Good. Thank you. Look across the street. Taxi. Stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out. Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?
Don't stare.
We can't both stare.
Good for you. Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights.
Come on, John. Come on, John. We're losing him! Ah, no! This way. No, this way!
Police! Open her up! No. Teeth, tan: what - Californian? L.A., Santa Monica. Just arrived.
The luggage. It's probably your first trip to London, right, going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you?
Yeah. Everything all right?
Welcome to London.
Basically.
Not the murderer, no.
As they go.
Yeah. I pickpocket him when he's annoying. You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat. What?
Got your breath back?
And you invaded Afghanistan.
Oh, they can keep an eye out. It was a long shot anyway.
Oh, just passing the time. And proving a point.
You. Mrs Hudson! Doctor Watson will take the room upstairs.
Says the man at the door.
Mrs Hudson?
What are you doing?
You can't just break into my flat.
Well, what do you call this then?
John ...
John, you probably want to shut up now.
What?
Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.
What, An... Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?
Put those back!
It's an experiment.
This is childish.
Oh, what, so-so-so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?
I am clean!
I don't even smoke.
Who is she?
Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?
I'm not a psychopath, Anderson. I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research. You need to bring Rachel in. You need to question her. I need to question her.
Excellent! How, when and why? Is there a connection? There has to be.
No, that's ... that's not right. How ... Why would she do that? Why?
She didn't think about her daughter. She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt.
Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset? Not good?
Yeah, but if you were dying ... if you'd been murdered: in your very last few seconds what would you say?
Oh, use your imagination!
Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever ... Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers: she was clever. She's trying to tell us something.
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
Shut up, everybody, shut up! Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe. I'm trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off.
Come on, think. Quick!
MRS HUDSON! Oh. Ah! She was clever, clever, yes! She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him. When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.
Wha...? What do you mean, how? Rachel! Don't you see? Rachel! Oh, look at you lot. You're all so vacant. Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing. Rachel is not a name.
John, on the luggage, there's a label. E-mail address.
Oh, I've been too slow. She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled. So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address ... and all together now, the password is?
Anderson, don't talk out loud. You lower the I.Q. of the whole street. We can do much more than just read her e-mails. It's a smartphone, it's got GPS, which means if you lose it you can locate it online. She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.
Come on, come on. Quickly!
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother? We need to get vehicles, get a helicopter. We're gonna have to move fast. This phone battery won't last for ever.
It's a start!
It narrows it down from just anyone in London. It's the first proper lead that we've had.
What is it? Quickly, where?
How can it be here? How?
What, and I didn't notice it? Me? I didn't notice?
'Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?' 'Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?' 'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'
What? Yeah, yeah, I-I'm fine.
Dunno.
Good idea.
Fresh air. Just popping outside for a moment. Won't be long.
I'm fine.
I didn't order a taxi.
You're the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street. It was you, not your passenger.
Is this a confession?
Why?
Am I not?
No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result.
If I wanted to understand, what would I do?
So you can kill me too?
How did you find me?
Who warned you about me?
Who? Who would notice me?
I'm really not.
Tell me more.
Where are we?
Roland-Kerr Further Education College. Why here?
And you just walk your victims in? How? Oh, dull.
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.
No, I'm not.
Bit risky, wasn't it? Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen. They're not that stupid. And Mrs Hudson will remember you.
Love what?
My fan?
Oh, I see. So you're a proper genius too.
Okay, two bottles. Explain.
Both bottles are of course identical.
And you know which is which.
But I don't.
Why should I? I've got nothing to go on. What's in it for me?
This is what you did to the rest of them: you gave them a choice.
It's not a game. It's chance.
Play what? It's a fifty-fifty chance.
Still just chance.
Luck.
Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie.
So, you risked your life four times just to kill strangers. Why?
Oh, I am playing. This is my turn. There's shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you. Traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own; there's no-one to tell you. But there's a photograph of children. The children's mother has been cut out of the picture. If she'd died, she'd still be there. The photograph's old but the frame's new. You think of your children but you don't get to see them. Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them and it still hurts. Ah, but there's more. Your clothes: recently laundered but everything you're wearing's at least ... three years old? Keeping up appearances but not planning ahead. And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about? Ahh. Three years ago - is that when they told you?
That you're a dead man walking.
You don't have long, though. Am I right?
And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people.
No. No, there's something else. You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your children.
But how?
Or serial killing.
Surprise me.
You have a what?
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?
What d'you mean, more than a man? An organisation? What?
What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here.
I'll have the gun, please.
Definitely. The gun.
The gun. I know a real gun when I see one.
Clearly. Well, this has been very interesting. I look forward to the court case.
Of course. Child's play.
Was I right? I was, wasn't I? Did I get it right? Okay, tell me this: your sponsor. Who was it? The one who told you about me - my 'fan'. I want a name.
You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you. Give me a name. A name. Now. The NAME!
Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me.
I'm not in shock.
So, the shooter. No sign?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon - that's a crack shot you're looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatised to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service ... and nerves of steel ... Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.
Ignore all of that. It's just the, er, the shock talking.
I just need to talk about the-the rent.
Oh, what now? I'm in shock! Look, I've got a blanket!
And I just caught you a serial killer ... more or less.
Good shot.
Well, you'd know. Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case. Are you all right?
Well, you have just killed a man.
No. No, he wasn't really, was he?
That's true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!
You're the one who shot him. Don't blame me.
Sorry.
Course I wasn't. Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.
Why would I do that?
Dinner?
End of Baker Street, there's a good Chinese stays open 'til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle.
I know exactly who that is.
What are you doing here?
Yes, I've been hearing about your 'concern'.
Oddly enough, no!
I upset her? Me? It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.
Mother - our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft. Putting on weight again?
Of course he's my brother.
Not what?
Close enough.
He is the British government, when he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis. Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before I get home. You know what it does for the traffic.
Mmm! I can always predict the fortune cookies.
Almost can. You did get shot, though.
In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound.
Shoulder! I thought so.
The left one.
I never guess.
Moriarty.
I've absolutely no idea.
Look! 
You took your time. 
What? Why not? 
You ... you had a row with a machine? 
Take my card. 
Not interested. I sent them a message. 
Of course. 
Mine was in the bedroom. 
In a manner of speaking. Took me less than a minute to guess yours. Not exactly Fort Knox. 
Oh, dull. 
I need to go to the bank. 
Sherlock Holmes. 
Sebastian. 
This is my friend, John Watson. 
So, you're doing well. You've been abroad a lot. 
Flying all the way round the world twice in a month? 
It's not a trick. 
I simply observed. 
No, I ... 
I was just chatting with your secretary outside. She told me. 
How many ways into that office? 
That door didn't open last night. 
I don't need an incentive, Sebastian. 
Did you see his watch? 
The time was right but the date was wrong. Said two days ago. Crossed the dateline twice but he didn't alter it. 
New Breitling. Only came out this February. 
Got everything I need to know already, thanks. 
That graffiti was a message for someone at the bank working on the trading floors. We find the intended recipient and ... 
Obvious. 
Pillars. 
Pillars and the screens. Very few places you can see that graffiti from. That narrows the field considerably. And of course the message was left at eleven thirty-four last night. That tells us a lot. 
Traders come to work at all hours. Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night. That message was intended for someone who came in at midnight. Not many Van Coons in the phonebook. Taxi! 
Just moved in. 
The floor above. New label. 
No-one ever does that. 
Hi! Um, I live in the flat just below you. I-I don't think we've met. 
Actually, I've just locked my keys in my flat. 
Yeah. And can I use your balcony? 
We don't know that it was suicide. 
Been away three days, judging by the laundry. Look at the case. There was something tightly packed inside it. 
Problem? 
Those symbols at the bank - the graffiti. Why were they put there? 
Obviously. Why were they painted? If you want to communicate, why not use e-mail? 
Oh good. You follow. 
What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid? What about this morning - those letters you were looking at? 
Yes. He was being threatened. 
Ah, Sergeant. We haven't met. 
I've phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way? 
Wrong. It's one possible explanation of some of the facts. You've got a solution that you like, but you're choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it. 
The wound was on the right side of his head. 
Van Coon was left-handed. Requires quite a bit of contortion. 
Oh, I'm amazed you didn't notice. All you have to do is look around this flat. Coffee table on the left-hand side; coffee mug handle pointing to the left. Power sockets: habitually used the ones on the left ... Pen and paper on the left-hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left. D'you want me to go on? 
Oh, I might as well; I'm almost at the bottom of the list. There's a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left. It's highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head. 
Conclusion: someone broke in here and murdered him. Only explanation of all the facts. 
He was waiting for the killer. He'd been threatened. 
He fired a shot when his attacker came in. 
Went through the open window. 
Wait until you get the ballistics report. The bullet in his brain wasn't fired from his gun. I guarantee it. 
Good! You're finally asking the right questions. 
It was a threat. That's what the graffiti meant. 
I don't think this can wait. Sorry, Sebastian. One of your traders - someone who worked in your office - was killed. 
Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion. Still wanna make an appointment? Would, maybe, nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit? 
Well, they've got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered. 
Seb. 
I said, "Could you pass me a pen?" 
'Bout an hour ago. 
Yeah, I went to see about a job at that surgery. 
How was it? 
Who? 
"She"? 
Here, have a look. 
Happened last night. Journalist shot dead in his flat; doors locked, windows bolted from the inside - exactly the same as Van Coon. 
He's killed another one.
Brian Lukis, freelance journalist. Murdered in his flat ... doors locked from the inside. 
Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another City suicide? You have seen the ballistics report, I suppose? 
And the shot that killed him: was it fired from his own gun? 
No. So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel. I've just handed you a murder enquiry. Five minutes in his flat. 
Four floors up. That's why they think they're safe. Put a chain across the door and bolt it shut; think they're impregnable. They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in. 
You're dealing with a killer who can climb. 
He clings to the walls like an insect. That's how he got in. 
Climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight. 
He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building, jumped the balcony to kill Van Coon. 
And of course that's how he got into the bank. He ran along the window ledge and onto the terrace. We have to find out what connects these two men. 
Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died. 
So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon; Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in. Hours later, he dies. 
Late that night, he dies too. 
Only the cipher can tell us. 
The world's run on codes and ciphers, John. From the million-pound security system at the bank, to the PIN machine you took exception to, cryptography inhabits our every waking moment. 
... but it's all computer-generated: electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods. This is different. It's an ancient device. Modern code-breaking methods won't unravel it. 
I need to ask some advice. 
You heard me perfectly. I'm not saying it again. 
On painting, yes. I need to talk to an expert. 
Interesting. 
Know the author? 
What about the symbols: d'you recognise them? 
Two men have been murdered, Raz. Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them. 
Are you gonna help us or not? 
Somebody must know something about it. 
You've been a while. 
What? 
Good. Fine. 
This symbol: I still can't place it. No, I need you to go to the police station ... 
... ask about the journalist. 
His personal effects will have been impounded. Get hold of his diary, or something that will tell us his movements. Gonna go and see Van Coon's P.A. If we retrace their steps, somewhere they'll coincide. 
Can you print me up a copy? 
What about the day he died? Can you tell me where he was? 
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative? 
Like that hand cream. He bought that for you, didn't he? Look at this one. Got a taxi from home on the day he died. Eighteen pounds fifty. 
Not rush hour; check the time. Mid-morning. Eighteen would get him as far as ... 
Underground. Printed at one in Piccadilly. 
Because he was delivering something heavy. Didn't want to lug a package up the escalator. 
To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it and then ... stopped on his way. He got peckish. 
So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station, but where were you headed from? Where did the taxi drop you ...? 
Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died - whatever was hidden inside that case. I've managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information ... 
... credit card bills, receipts. He flew back from China, then he came here. 
Somewhere in this street; somewhere near. I don't know where, but ... 
How can you tell? 
Oh. 
Yes, I see it. 
It's an ancient number system! Hangzhou. These days, only street traders use it. Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library. Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect. 
And the blindfold - the horizontal line? That was a number as well. The Chinese number one, John. 
It's not what they saw; it's what they both brought back in those suitcases. 
Think about what Sebastian told us; about Van Coon - about how he stayed afloat in the market. 
... made it back in a week. 
That's how he made such easy money. 
A guy like him - it would have been perfect. Business man ... 
... making frequent trips to Asia. And Lukis was the same ... a journalist writing about China. 
Both of them smuggled stuff out, and the Lucky Cat was their drop-off. 
What if one of them was light-fingered? 
Stole something; something from the hoard. 
Remind me ... when was the last time that it rained? 
It's been here since Monday. No-one's been in that flat for at least three days. 
D'you leave your windows open when you go on holiday? 
Someone else has been here. Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase just like I did. 
I'm not the first. 
Somebody's been in here before me! 
Size eight feet. Small, but ... athletic. 
Small, strong hands. Our acrobat. But why didn't he close the window when he left ...? Oh, stupid. Stupid. Obvious. He's still here. 
John! John! 
The, uh, milk's gone off and the washing's starting to smell. Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago. 
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her. 
Maybe we could start with this. 
I'm fine. 
When was the last time that you saw her? 
What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon? 
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao. 
Forget about your court date. 
If you want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it, wouldn't you say? People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher the message. 
They have been in here. And that's the exact same paint? 
John, if we're going to decipher this code, we're gonna need to look for more evidence. 
Somebody doesn't want me to see it. 
Shh, John, concentrate. I need you to concentrate. Close your eyes. 
I need you to maximise your visual memory. Try to picture what you saw. Can you picture it? 
Can you remember it? 
Can you remember the pattern? 
How much can you remember it? 
Because the average human memory on visual matters is only sixty-two percent accurate. 
Really? 
Always in pairs, John. 
Numbers come with partners. 
Why did he paint it so near the tracks? 
Thousands of people pass by there every day. 
Of course. Of course! He wants information. He's trying to communicate with his people in the underworld. Whatever was stolen, he wants it back. Somewhere here in the code. We can't crack this without Soo Lin Yao. 
Two men who travelled back from China were murdered, and their killer left them messages in the Hangzhou numerals. 
Tell me more about those teapots. 
Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining. Now there are two. 
Fancy a biscuit with that? Centuries old. Don't wanna break that. Hello.
You've been clever to avoid him so far. 
Who is he? Have you met him before? 
The cipher. 
The Spider. 
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong. 
Ancient crime syndicate based in China. 
Who are they? 
Then he came looking for you. 
Can you decipher these? 
Yes, I know. 
And this one is fifteen. But what's the code? 
Careful! Some of those skulls are over two hundred thousand years old! Have a bit of respect! Thank you(!) 
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working for a gang of international smugglers - a gang called the Black Lotus operating here in London right under your nose. 
What are you thinking: pork or the pasta? 
This place is never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it? I'd stick with the pasta. Don't wanna be doing roast pork - not if you're slicing up cadavers. 
Don't eat when I'm working. Digesting slows me down. 
Need to examine some bodies. 
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis. 
Could you wheel them out again for me? 
You've ... changed your hair. 
The-the style: it's usually parted in the middle. 
Mmm, it's good; it, um, suits you better this way. 
We're just interested in the feet. 
Yes. D'you mind if we have a look at them? Now Van Coon. Oh(!) 
So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour or I'm telling the truth. 
I want every book from Lukis' apartment and Van Coon's. 
Not just a criminal organisation; it's a cult. Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders. 
Yes, Shan; General Shan. 
Wrong. We've got almost all we need to know. She gave us most of the missing pieces. Why did he need to visit his sister? Why did he need her expertise? 
Exactly. 
Valuable antiquities, John. Ancient Chinese relics purchased on the black market. China's home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao's revolution. 
Check for the dates ... Here, John. 
Arrived from China four days ago. Anonymous. Vendor doesn't give his name. Two undiscovered treasures from the East. 
... antiquities sold at auction. Look, here's another one. 
Arrived from China a month ago: Chinese ceramic statue, sold four hundred thousand. 
All of them from an anonymous source. They're stealing them back in China and one by one they're feeding them into Britain. 
So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China? What if one of them stole something? 
What? 
So, the numbers are references. 
To specific pages and specific words on those pages. 
Turn to page fifteen and it's the first word you read. 
Depends on the book. That's the cunning of the book code. Has to be one that they both owned. 
Some silence right now would be marvellous. "Cigarette." 
"Imagine." 
A book that everybody would own. Fifteen. Entry one. I need to get some air. We're going out tonight. 
What? 
That's what I was suggesting. 
Where are you taking her? 
Oh, dull, boring, predictable. Why don't you try this? In London for one night only. 
And then I phoned back and got one for myself as well. I'm Sherlock. 
Hello. 
Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day. It fits. The Tong sent an assassin to England ... 
We're looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope. Where else would you find that level of dexterity? Exit visas are scarce in China. They need a pretty good reason to get out of that country. Now, all I need to do is have a quick look round the place ... 
I need your help. 
Like what? 
What's so important? 
What? 
This is not their day job. 
Classic Chinese escapology act. 
The crossbow's on a delicate string. The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires. 
She splits the sandbag; the sand pours out; gradually the weight lowers into the bowl. 
Well, well. Found you. 
Come on! Let's go! 
Look, I saw the mark at the circus - that tattoo that we saw on the two bodies: the mark of the Tong. 
These circus performers were gang members sent here to get it back. 
No, they won't leave without what they came for. We need to find their hide-out; the rendezvous. 
Somewhere in this message it must tell us. 
Yes, it would be better to study if you left now. 
Ooh, God. 
Consulting detective. 
They're numbers. An ancient Chinese dialect. 
Exactly. 
How did you know that? 
John. 
John, look at this. Soo Lin at the museum - she started to translate the code for us. We didn't see it! "NINE," "MILL." 
Nine million quid. For what? We need to know the end of this sentence. 
To the museum; to the restoration room. Oh, we must have been staring right at it! 
The book, John. The book - the key to cracking the cipher! Soo Lin used it to do this! Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code. It must be on her desk. 
Taxi! 
[Forgive me, please.] 
A book that everybody would own. Please, wait! [Please!] 
[Wait a minute!] 
Page fifteen, entry one. Page fifteen, entry one ... Dead man. You were threatening to kill them. It's the first cipher. Thirty-seven, nine; thirty-seven, nine ... Nine mill ... for ... 
Sixty, thirty-five. Jade. Jade. 
"NINE MILL FOR JADE PIN DRAGON DEN BLACK ... TRAMWAY." 
John! John! I've got it! The cipher! The book! It's the London A to Z that they're using... 
Tramway. Oh, Christ. There. 
You should, you know. Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him. 
How would you describe me, John? Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic? 
That's a semi-automatic. If you fire it, the bullet will travel at over a thousand metres per second. 
Well ... the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres. If you miss, the bullet will ricochet. Could hit anyone. Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you. 
It's all right. You're gonna be all right. It's over now. It's over. 
We'll just slip off. No need to mention us in your report. 
I have high hopes for you, Inspector. A glittering career. 
Exactly. 
Million. 
An instruction to all their London operatives. 
A message; what they were trying to reclaim. 
Worth nine million pounds. Bring it to the Tramway, their London hideout. 
Apparently. 
Depends who owned it. 
Two operatives based in London. They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases. One of them helps himself to something: a little hairpin. 
Eddie Van Coon was the thief. He stole the treasure when he was in China. 
Because of the soap. 
He bought you a present. 
A little gift when he came back from China. 
You weren't just his P.A., were you? 
No. 
Scented hand soap in his apartment. Three hundred millilitres of it. Bottle almost finished. 
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap - not unless he had a lady coming over. And it's the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk. 
What happened? Why did you end it? 
And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry. Can I ... just have a look at it? 
Oh, I don't think that's true. I think he pinched it. 
Didn't know its value; just thought it would suit you. 
Nine ... million ... pounds. 
He didn't know its value; didn't know why they were chasing him. 
Hmm. 
What? 
It must be a vast network, John; thousands of operatives. You and I, we barely scratched the surface. 
No. No. I cracked this code; all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book. 
Just tell me what happened, from the beginning. 
Wasn't a real man. 
It's not "weren't"; it's "wasn't." 
Go on. 
"Taught." 
Taught you how to cut up a beast. 
"Did it." 
No, no, no, Mr Berwick, not at all. Hanged, yes. 
Bored. 
Bored! 
Bored! Bored! Don't know what's got into the criminal classes. Good job I'm not one of them. 
Ah, the wall had it coming. 
Belarus. Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time. 
Just tea for me, thanks. 
Yes. 
Well, where else was I supposed to put it? You don't mind, do you? I got it from Bart's morgue. I'm measuring the coagulation of saliva after death. I see you've written up the taxi driver case. 
"A Study in Pink." Nice(!) 
Erm, no. 
Flattered? "Sherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds. What's incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is about some things." 
Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant" in a nice way(!) Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister ... 
... or who's sleeping with who ... 
Not that again. It's not important. 
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it. 
Listen. This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful ... really useful. Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see? 
Oh, hell! What does that matter?! So we go round the Sun! If we went round the Moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn't make any difference. All that matters to me is the work. Without that, my brain rots. Put that in your blog. Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world. Where are you going? 
Look at that, Mrs Hudson. Quiet, calm, peaceful. Isn't it hateful? 
Can't come too soon. 
John. 
Hmm? What? Oh, yeah. Fine. Gas leak, apparently. I can't. 
The stuff I've got on is just too big. I can't spare the time. 
How's the diet? 
If you're so keen, why don't you investigate it? 
How's Sarah, John? How was the lilo? 
Oh yes, of course. 
I'd like to see you try. 
Why shouldn't I? 
Sherlock Holmes. Of course. How could I refuse? Lestrade. I've been summoned. Coming? 
Of course. I'd be lost without my blogger. 
Obviously. 
Gas leak, yes? 
No? 
You haven't opened it? 
How reassuring(!)  Nice stationery. Bohemian. 
From the Czech Republic. No fingerprints? 
She used a fountain pen. A Parker Duofold - iridium nib. 
Obviously. 
Well, obviously it's not the same phone but it's supposed to look like ... The Study in Pink? You read his blog? 
It isn't the same phone. This one's brand new. Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone, which means your blog has a far wider readership. 
No. That's not it. 
It's a warning. 
Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that. Five pips. They're warning us it's gonna happen again. And I've seen this place before. 
Boom! 
Mrs Hudson! 
The door's been opened recently. 
Hello? 
Who's this? 
Who's talking? Why are you crying? 
The curtain rises. 
Nothing. 
I've been expecting this for some time. 
Hmm? 
Oh, she doesn't matter. She's just a hostage. No lead there. 
You're not going to be much use to her. 
The bomber's too smart for that. Pass me my phone. 
Jacket. Careful. 
Delete it. 
Missile plans are out of the country now. Nothing we can do about it. 
Then why didn't he cancel his dental appointment? 
Mycroft never texts if he can talk. Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains. End of story. The only mystery is this: why is my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting? 
What for? This hospital's full of people dying, Doctor. Why don't you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them? Ah! 
Oh, yes! 
Gay. 
Nothing. Um, hey. 
And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly. You've put on three pounds since I last saw you. 
Nuh, three. 
With that level of personal grooming? 
You wash your hair. There's a difference. No-no - tinted eyelashes; clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines; those tired clubber's eyes. Then there's his underwear. 
Visible above the waistline - very visible; very particular brand. That, plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish here ... and I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain. 
Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder? 
Go on, then. 
You know what I do. Off you go. 
Go on. 
An outside eye, a second opinion. It's very useful to me. 
Really. 
Good. 
You're on sparkling form. What else? 
But ...? 
Excellent. What else? 
That's it? 
Well, John; really well. I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, um, you know ... The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean, whitened them where they got discoloured. Changed the laces three ... no, four times. Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he suffered from eczema. Shoes are well-worn, more so on the inside, which means the owner had weak arches. British-made, twenty years old. 
They're not retro - they're original. Limited edition: two blue stripes, nineteen eighty-nine. 
Someone's kept them that way. Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles. Analysis shows it's from Sussex, with London mud overlaying it. 
Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me. South of the river, too. So, the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex twenty years ago and left them behind. 
Something bad. He loved those shoes, remember. He'd never leave them filthy. Wouldn't leave them go unless he had to. So: a child with big feet gets ... Oh. 
Carl Powers. 
Carl Powers, John. 
It's where I began.
Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid - champion swimmer - came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident. You wouldn't remember it. Why should you? 
Yes. 
Nobody thought so - nobody except me. I was only a kid myself. I read about it in the papers. 
The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out it was too late. But there was something wrong; something I couldn't get out of my head. 
His shoes. 
They weren't there. I made a fuss; I tried to get the police interested, but nobody seemed to think it was important. He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his locker, but there was no sign of his shoes ... until now. 
Must be a root canal. 
How quaint. 
You are. Queen and country. 
I'm not ignoring it. Putting my best man onto it right now. 
Poison. 
Clostridium botulinum! It's one of the deadliest poisons on the planet! Carl Powers! 
Remember the shoelaces? 
The boy suffered from eczema. It'd be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication. Two hours later he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles and he drowns. 
It's virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it. But there were still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he put the cream on his feet. That's why they had to go. 
Get his attention ... 
... stop the clock. 
Yes. Meaning ... 
Where are you? Tell us where you are. 
And if she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off. 
Oh. Elegant. 
Oh - I can't be the only person in the world that gets bored. 
First test passed, it would seem. Here's the second. It's abandoned, wouldn't you say? 
Hello? 
Who is this? Is this you again? 
And you've stolen another voice, I presume. 
Who are you? What's that noise? 
No body. 
Get a sample sent to the lab. Mrs Monkford? 
Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband's. We, um ... we grew up together. 
Oh, he must have done. This is ... this is horrible, isn't it? I mean, I just can't believe it. I only saw him the other day. Same old Ian - not a care in the world. 
Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that? It's a bit suspicious, isn't it? 
Oh, well, that was Ian! That was Ian all over! 
Wasn't it? Interesting. 
People don't like telling you things, but they love to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice? 
I referred to her husband in the past tense. She joined in. Bit premature - they've only just found the car. 
Definitely not. That's not a mistake a murderer would make. 
Janus Cars. Just found this in the glove compartment. 
Is that one? 
But, er, surely you can afford one - a Mazda, I mean? 
Nice holiday, Mr Ewert? 
You've been away, haven't you? 
Have you got any change for the cigarette machine? 
Well, I noticed one on the way in and I haven't got any change. I'm gasping. 
Oh well. Thank you very much for your time, Mr Ewert. You've been very helpful. Come on, John. 
Nicotine patches, remember? I'm doing well. 
I needed to look inside his wallet. 
Mr Ewert's a liar. 
Hello? 
Why would you be giving me a clue? 
Then talk to me in your own voice. 
How much blood was on that seat, would you say? 
Not 'about.' Exactly a pint. That was their first mistake. The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's but it's been frozen. 
There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that's what they spread on the seats. 
Janus Cars. The clue's in the name. 
Exactly. 
They provide a very special service. If you've got any kind of a problem - money troubles, bad marriage, whatever - Janus Cars will help you disappear. Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in some kind of trouble - financial, at a guess; he's a banker. Couldn't see a way out. But if he were to vanish, if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver's seat ... 
Colombia. 
Mr Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Colombian peso note in his wallet ... Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn't been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly. No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed. That, plus his arm. 
Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. Why? Because he'd recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell at that distance. Conclusion: he'd just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia. Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars. 
Oh yes. She's in on it too. Now go and arrest them, Inspector. That's what you do best. We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved. I am on fire! 
Feeling better? 
Probably. 
Yes, I know. 
Perhaps. That could be anybody. 
How d'you mean? 
Hello? 
Why are you doing this? 
No. 
Not any more. So: dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound. Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream - good night Vienna. 
Something's wrong with this picture. 
Can't be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn't be directing us towards it. Something's wrong. John? 
The cut on her hand: it's deep; would have bled a lot, right? 
But the wound's clean - very clean, and fresh. How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her? 
Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman's system? You want to help, right? 
Connie Prince's background - family history, everything. Give me data. 
Is there? 
Good Samaritan. 
Bad Samaritan. 
Something new. 
Connection, connection, connection. There must be a connection. Carl Powers, killed twenty years ago. The bomber knew him; admitted that he knew him. The bomber's iPhone was in stationery from the Czech Republic. First hostage from Cornwall; the second from London; the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent. What's he doing - working his way round the world? Showing off? 
Great. ... Thank you. Thanks again. 
Home Office. 
Well, Home Secretary, actually. Owes me a favour. 
Not until now. 
So I gather. I've just been having a very fruitful chat with people who loved this show. Fan sites - indispensible for gossip. 
John. 
I'll remember.
Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it? 
Very good to meet you. 
So sorry to hear about ... 
Oh yes? 
Oh, who's this? 
How nice(!) Was she Connie's? 
Oh, um ... Two point eight. 
Sorry. 
What? 
You think it was the cat. It wasn't the cat. 
Lovely idea. 
I thought of it the minute I saw the scratches on her arm, but it's too random and too clever for the brother. 
Did he? 
No. It was revenge. 
Raoul, the houseboy. Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister's jokes, week in, week out, a virtual bullying campaign. Finally he had enough; fell out with her badly. It's all on the website. She threatened to disinherit Kenny. Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle, so ... 
Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed to within an inch of its life. You smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn't come into it. Raoul's internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here. 
Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince's houseboy. Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince - it was botulinum toxin. We've been here before. Carl Powers? Tut-tut. Our bomber's repeated himself. 
Botox injection. 
Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections. My contact at the Home Office gave me the complete records of Raoul's internet purchases. He's been bulk ordering Botox for months. Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose. 
I'm sure. 
What? 
Well, this one was quite simple, actually, and like I said, the bomber repeated himself. That was a mistake. 
I knew I could save her. I also knew that the bomber had given us twelve hours. I solved the case quickly; that gave me time to get on with other things. Don't you see? We're one up on him! 
Hello? 
Tell us where you are. Address. 
No, no, no, no. Tell me nothing about him. Nothing. 
Hello? 
Well, obviously I lost that round - although technically I did solve the case. He killed the old lady because she started to describe him. Just once, he put himself in the firing line. 
Well, usually, he must stay above it all. He organises these things but no-one ever has direct contact. 
Novel. 
Taking his time this time. 
Nothing. All the living classmates check out spotless. No connection. 
The thought had occurred. 
I think he wants to be distracted. 
Sorry, what? 
Will caring about them help save them? 
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake. 
Yes, very. Is that news to you? 
I've disappointed you. 
Don't make people into heroes, John. Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them. Excellent! View of the Thames. South Bank - somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo. You check the papers; I'll look online ... Oh, you're angry with me, so you won't help. Not much cop, this caring lark. 
Ten a penny. 
Nothing! It's me. Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge? 
Must be. Odd, though ... he hasn't been in touch. 
Yes. 
Seven ... so far. 
Fingertips. 
He's been in the river a long while. The water's destroyed most of the data. But I'll tell you one thing: that lost Vermeer painting's a fake. 
We need to identify the corpse. Find out about his friends and associates ... 
It's all over the place. Haven't you seen the posters? Dutch Old Master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago; now it's turned up. Worth thirty million pounds. 
Everything. Have you ever heard of the Golem? 
Jewish folk story. A gigantic man made of clay. It's also the name of an assassin - real name Oskar Dzundza - one of the deadliest assassins in the world. That is his trademark style. 
Definitely. The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands. 
You do see - you just don't observe. 
What do we know about this corpse? The killer's not left us with much - just the shirt and the trousers. They're pretty formal - maybe he was going out for the night, but the trousers are heavy-duty, polyester, nasty, same as the shirt - cheap. They're both too big for him, so some kind of standard-issue uniform. Dressed for work, then. What kind of work? There's a hook on his belt for a walkie-talkie. 
More likely. That'll be borne out by his backside. 
Flabby. You'd think that he'd led a sedentary life, yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise. So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around. Security guard's looking good. And the watch helps, too. The alarm shows he did regular night shifts. 
No-no-no, the buttons are stiff, hardly touched. He set his alarm like that a long time ago. His routine never varied. But there's something else. The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution. Found this inside his trouser pockets. Sodden by the river but still recognisably ... 
Ticket stubs. He worked in a museum or gallery. Did a quick check - the Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing. Alex Woodbridge. Tonight they unveil the re-discovered masterpiece. Now why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant? Inference: the dead man knew something about it - something that would stop the owner getting paid thirty million pounds. The picture's a fake. 
Meretricious. 
Pointless. You'll never find him. But I know a man who can. 
Me. 
Why hasn't he phoned? He's broken his pattern. Why? Waterloo Bridge. 
In a bit. 
Dunno. Dangerous to jump to conclusions. Need data. Stop! You wait here. I won't be a moment. 
What for? 
Here you go - fifty. 
Investing. Now we go to the Gallery. Have you got any cash? 
No. I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant. Lestrade will give you the address. 
Just admiring the view. 
Doesn't it bother you? 
That the painting's a fake. 
It's a fake. It has to be. It's the only possible explanation. You're in charge, aren't you, Miss Wenceslas? 
Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake, so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him. Was it you? 
Or are you working for someone else? Did you fake it for them? 
It is a fake. Don't know why, but there's something wrong with it. There has to be. 
Not a problem. 
No. I don't work here, you see. Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice. 
Please. 
The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight. 
Sherlock Holmes. 
You should be. Have a nice day! 
And? 
Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality? 
Hold that cab. 
Don't mind if I do. 
Fortunately, I haven't been idle. Come on. 
Beautiful, isn't it? 
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it. 
This way. 
Homeless network - really is indispensible. 
My eyes and ears all over the city. 
Yes, then I disinfect myself. 
Come on! 
Well, he has a very distinctive look. He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wag - much. 
What? 
Don't mention it. No, no, no, no! It'll take us weeks to find him again. 
What? 
Golem! 
John! 
Who are you working for this time, Dzundza? 
It's a fake. It has to be. 
It's a very good fake, then. You know about this, don't you? This is you, isn't it? 
The painting is a fake. It's a fake. That's why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed. Oh, come on. Proving it's just the detail. The painting is a fake. I've solved it. I've figured it out. It's a fake! That's the answer. That's why they were killed. Okay, I'll prove it. Give me time. Will you give me time? 
"Ten." 
It's a countdown. He's giving me time. 
The painting is a fake, but how can I prove it? How? How? 
This kid will die. Tell me why the painting is a fake. Tell me! 
No, shut up. Don't say anything. It only works if I figure it out. Must be possible. Must be staring me in the face. 
Woodbridge knew, but how? 
Oh! 
In the planetarium! You heard it too. Oh, that is brilliant! That is gorgeous! 
This is beautiful. I love this! 
The Van Buren Supernova! 
There you go. Go find out where he is and pick him up. The Van Buren Supernova, so-called. Exploding star, only appeared in the sky in eighteen fifty-eight. 
You know, it's interesting. Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas. This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it. Is that where this leads? What are we looking at, Inspector? 
Hmm! 
Who? 
And did those whispers have a name? 
Points. 
Knew you'd get there eventually. West wasn't killed here; that's why there was so little blood. 
Since the start. You don't think I'd give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you? Come on. Got a bit of burglary to do. 
The missile defence plans haven't left the country, otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it. Despite what people think, we do still have a Secret Service. 
Which means whoever stole the memory stick can't sell it or doesn't know what to do with it. My money's on the latter. We're here. 
There isn't. 
Oh, sorry, didn't I say? Joe Harrison's flat. 
Brother of West's fiancée. He stole the memory stick; killed his prospective brother-in-law. 
Let's ask him. 
But stealing the plans for the missile defence programme wasn't an accident, was it? 
When a neat little idea popped into your head. Carrying Andrew West way away from here. His body would have gone on for ages if the train hadn't met a stretch of track that curved. 
Exactly. 
Fetch it for me - if you wouldn't mind. Distraction over, the game continues. 
Five pips, remember, John? It's a countdown. We've only had four. 
No, no, no! Of course he's not the boy's father! Look at the turn-ups on his jeans! 
Hmm? 
Hmm. Not a patch on Connie Prince. 
Yep. He was over the moon. Threatened me with a knighthood - again. 
Hmm? 
Didn't do you any good, did it? 
True. 
Mm! 
I'll get some. 
Really. 
Mmm. 
Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present. Oh, that's what it's all been for, hasn't it? All your little puzzles; making me dance - all to distract me from this. 
John. What the hell ...? 
Stop it. 
Who are you? 
Both. 
"Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover's nasty sister?" "Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?" 
Consulting criminal. Brilliant. 
I did. 
Thank you. 
Yes you did. 
People have died. 
I will stop you. 
You all right? 
Take it. 
Oh, let me guess: I get killed. 
I have been reliably informed that I don't have one. 
What if I was to shoot you now - right now? 
Catch ... you ... later. 
All right? Are you all right? 
Me? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Fine. That, er ... thing that you, er, that you did - that, um ... you offered to do. That was, um ... good. 
Hmm? 
People do little else. 
Probably my answer has crossed yours. 
No, no, please. You've got the rest of your life.
Oh. Did you get a better offer?
Someone changed his mind. The question is: who?
What are you typing?
About?
You mean me.
Well, you're typing a lot. Right then. So, what have we got?
Boring.
Yes.
Leave.
Boring.
Oh. Interesting.
'Geek Interpreter.' What's that?
What does it need a title for?
Do people actually read your blog?
I have a website.
Oh, for God's sakes!
"The Speckled Blonde"?!
People don't really go to heaven when they die. They're taken to a special room and burned.
Suspected terrorist bomb. We do watch the news.
Eight, so far. Okay, four ideas. Maybe two ideas.
No, no, no, don't mention the unsolved ones.
Why?
No they're not. Why are they?
Sorry, what?
Two hundred and forty-three.
So, what's this one? "Belly Button Murders"?
Eurgh!
Well, they won't be interested in us.
For God's sake! John. Cover your face and walk fast.
I'm a private detective. The last thing I need is a public image.
Tell us from the start. Don't be boring.
It's okay, I'm fine. Now, show me to the stream.
Look, this is a six. There's no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven. We agreed. Now, go back. Show me the grass.
We agreed it yesterday. Stop! Closer.
Well, it's hardly my fault you weren't listening. SHUT UP!
I don't know. How often are you away? Now, show me the car that backfired.
That's the one that made the noise, yes?
Oh, forget him. He's an idiot. Why else would he think himself a suspect?
Pass me over.
Up a bit! I'm not talking from down 'ere!
Having driven to an isolated location and successfully committed a crime without a single witness, why would he then call the police and consult a detective? Fair play?(!)
Did you see him? Morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own, the right sleeve of an internet porn addict and the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition. Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy - and you think he's an audacious criminal mastermind?! Don't worry - this is just stupid.
Go to the stream.
Go and see.
Who the hell are you?
Oh, I know exactly where I'm going.
No.
I don't know.
Oh, apparently yes.
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.
Transparent.
What for?
And my client is?
I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend. Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients. I'm used to mystery at one end of my cases. Both ends is too much work. Good morning.
Get off my sheet!
Or I'll just walk away.
Who. Is. My. Client?
And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.
Why? You have a police force of sorts, even a marginally Secret Service. Why come to me?
Not, to date, anyone with a Navy.
Nothing whatsoever.
You know I don't concern myself with trivia. Who is she?
Dominatrix.
Sex doesn't alarm me.
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs.
Hardly a difficult deduction. Photographs of whom?
How many photographs?
Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together?
And I assume in a number of compromising scenarios.
John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now.
How?
What case? Pay her, now and in full. As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead, "Know when you are beaten."
Oh, a power play. A power play with the most powerful family in Britain. Now that is a dominatrix. Ooh, this is getting rather fun, isn't it?
Hmm. Where is she?
Text me the details. I'll be in touch by the end of the day.
No, I think I'll have the photographs.
I'll need some equipment, of course.
Can I have a box of matches?
Or your cigarette lighter. Either will do.
No, I know you don't, but your employer does.
I'm not the Commonwealth.
Laters!
The evidence was right under your nose, John. As ever, you see but do not observe.
The ashtray.
Going into battle, John. I need the right armour. No.
We know her address.
Exactly. Just here, please.
Then it's time to add a splash of colour.
Two streets away, but this'll do.
Punch me in the face.
Yes. Punch me, in the face. Didn't you hear me?
Oh, for God's sakes.
Thank you. That was - that was ...
Okay! I think we're done now, John.
You were a doctor!
Ooh! Um, sorry to disturb you. Um, I've just been attacked, um, and, um, I think they ... they took my wallet and, um, and my phone. Umm, please could you help me?
Thank you, thank you! Could you, please? Oh, would you ... would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come? Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Er, ooh!
Oh! Thank you!
I'm so sorry. I'm ... 
Miss Adler, I presume. 
I had some at the Palace. 
Clearly. 
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face? 
I don't think John knows where to look. 
If I wanted to look at naked women I'd borrow John's laptop. 
I confiscate it. 
What? 
That's not why I'm here. 
Positionofthecar ... Er, the position of the car relative to the hiker at the time of the backfire. That and the fact that the death blow was to the back of the head. That's all you need to know. 
He wasn't. 
I know it wasn't. 
The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room. 
So they are in this room. Thank you. John, man the door. Let no-one in. Two men alone in the countryside several yards apart, and one car. 
No, no. Looking takes ages. I'm just going to find them but you're moderately clever and we've got a moment, so let's pass the time. Two men, a car, and nobody else. The driver's trying to fix his engine. Getting nowhere. And the hiker's taking a moment, looking at the sky. Watching the birds? Any moment now, something's gonna happen. What? 
No, that's the result. What's going to happen? 
Oh, well, try to. 
Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic and take your clothes off to make an impression. Stop boring me and think. It's the new sexy. 
There's going to be a loud noise. 
Oh, noises are important. Noises can tell you everything. For instance ... Thank you. On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child. Amazing how fire exposes our priorities. Really hope you don't have a baby in here. All right, John, you can turn it off now. I said you can turn it off now. 
Hmm. Should always use gloves with these things, you know. Heaviest oil deposit's always on the first key used - that's quite clearly the three - but after that the sequence is almost impossible to read. I'd say from the make that it's a six digit code. Can't be your birthday - no disrespect but clearly you were born in the eighties; the eight's barely used, so ... 
Don't you want me on the floor too? 
American. Interesting. Why would you care? 
I don't know the code. 
Well, if you'd been listening, you'd know she didn't. 
I don't have the code. 
I don't know the code. 
She didn't tell me. I don't know it! 
No, stop! 
Vatican cameos. D'you mind? 
Don't be. 
There'll be more of them. They'll be keeping a eye on the building. 
Yes. On their way. 
Oh shut up. It's quick. Check the rest of the house. See how they got in. Well, that's the knighthood in the bag. 
All the photographs are on here, I presume. 
No you don't. You'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection. Unless the contents of this phone are provably unique, you wouldn't be able to sell them. 
Well, why would they be interested? Whatever's on the phone, it's clearly not just photographs. 
It was. 
Clearly. 
You're very calm. Well, your booby trap did just kill a man. 
What? What is that? What ...? 
No. 
No. 
I ... I ... 
John? John! 
How did I get here? 
Where is she? 
The woman. That woman. 
The woman. The woman woman! 
Of course I'll be fine. I am fine. I'm absolutely fine. 
Why would I need you? 
The photographs are perfectly safe. 
She's not interested in blackmail. She wants ... protection for some reason. I take it you've stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house? 
She'd applaud your choice of words. You see how this works: that camera phone is her "Get out of jail free" card. You have to leave her alone. Treat her like royalty, Mycroft. 
Text. 
Did you know there were other people after her too, Mycroft, before you sent John and I in there? CIA-trained killers, at an excellent guess. 
MYCROFT! 
Though do, in fact, shut up. 
There's nothing you can do and nothing she will do as far as I can see. 
Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter. I believe her user name is "TheWhipHand." 
What noise? 
It's a text alert. It means I've got a text. 
Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently, as a joke, personalised their text alert noise. 
It would seem so. 
I'll leave you to your deductions. 
Where do you get that idea? 
What else does she have? Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn't be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs. There's more. Much more. Something big's coming, isn't it? 
Oh, will I? 
Do give her my love. 
Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson. 
No thank you, Sarah. 
No-no-no, I can get this. No, Sarah was the doctor; and then there was the one with the spots; and then the one with the nose; and then ... who was after the boring teacher? 
Jeanette! Ah, process of elimination. Oh, dear Lord. 
Oh, everybody's saying hullo to each other. How wonderful(!) 
No stopping them, apparently. 
John? 
The counter on your blog: still says one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five. 
And you've got a photograph of me wearing that hat! 
No they don't. What people? 
Don't make jokes, Molly. 
No, she's sleeping with a P.E. teacher. 
Nope. 
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly, and you're serious about him. 
In fact, you're seeing him this very night and giving him a gift. 
Oh, come on. Surely you've all seen the present at the top of the bag - perfectly wrapped with a bow. All the others are slapdash at best. It's for someone special, then. The shade of red echoes her lipstick - either an unconscious association or one that she's deliberately trying to encourage. Either way, Miss Hooper has lurrrve on her mind. The fact that she's serious about him is clear from the fact she's giving him a gift at all. That would suggest long-term hopes, however forlorn; and that she's seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she's wearing. Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts ... 
I am sorry. Forgive me. Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper. 
No, it was me. 
My phone. 
Sorry, what? 
Thrilling that you've been counting. 'Scuse me. 
I said excuse me. 
I think you're going to find Irene Adler tonight. 
No, I mean you're going to find her dead. 
Yes. 
You didn't need to come in, Molly. 
Show me the rest of her. That's her. 
Why? 
Smoking indoors - isn't there one of those ... one of those law things? 
She had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on. She chose to give it up. 
Look at them. They all care so much. Do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us? 
This is low tar. 
Huh! Merry Christmas, Mycroft. 
Hope you didn't mess up my sock index this time. 
Helps me to think. 
The counter on your blog is still stuck at one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five. 
Faulty - or you've been hacked and it's a message. 
Just faulty. 
Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson. It'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet. What a tender world that would be. 
Then why don't you ask for it? 
I believe I do. 
First, get rid of your boys. 
I dislike being outnumbered. It makes for too much stupid in the room. 
Then get into the car and drive away. Don't try to trick me. You know who I am. It doesn't work. Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me. 
I'm unarmed. 
Oh, I insist. 
Moron. 
You're all right now, you're all right. 
Mrs Hudson's been attacked by an American. I'm restoring balance to the universe. 
Downstairs. Take her downstairs and look after her. 
I expect so. Now go. Lestrade. We've had a break-in at Baker Street. Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance. Oh, no-no-no-no-no, we're fine. No, it's the, uh, it's the burglar. He's got himself rather badly injured. Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull ... suspected punctured lung. He fell out of a window. 
It's all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector. I lost count. 
Of course, but she's fine. 
Don't be absurd. 
Safest place I know. 
Thank you. Shame on you, John Watson. 
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street? England would fall. 
Where no-one will look. 
Yes, it is. 
Happy New Year, John. 
It's a camera phone. 
Yes, I am. 
A woman's. 
You think she's my girlfriend because I'm X-raying her possessions? 
Yes. They do, don't they? Very silly. She sent this to my address, and she loves to play games. 
We have a client. 
So who's after you? 
Who's that? 
So you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them. 
Except you let John know that you were alive, and therefore me. 
You couldn't. 
If they've been watching me, they'll know that I took a safety deposit box at a bank on the Strand a few months ago. 
Very good, John. Excellent plan, with intelligent precautions. 
So what do you keep on here - in general, I mean? 
So how do you acquire this information? 
But you've acquired something that's more danger than protection. Do you know what it is? 
I assumed. Show me. The passcode. 
No, because it's a duplicate that I had made, into which you've just entered the numbers one oh five eight. I assumed you'd choose something more specific than that but, um, thanks anyway. 
Oh, you're rather good. 
Yes. 
There's a margin for error but I'm pretty sure there's a Seven Forty-Seven leaving Heathrow tomorrow at six thirty in the evening for Baltimore. Apparently it's going to save the world. Not sure how that can be true but give me a moment; I've only been on the case for eight seconds. Oh, come on. It's not code. These are seat allocations on a passenger jet. Look ... There's no letter 'I' because it can be mistaken for a '1'; no letters past 'K' - the width of the plane is the limit. The numbers always appear randomly and not in sequence but the letters have little runs of sequence all over the place - families and couples sitting together. Only a Jumbo is wide enough to need the letter 'K' or rows past fifty-five, which is why there's always an upstairs. There's a row thirteen, which eliminates the more superstitious airlines. Then there's the style of the flight number - zero zero seven - that eliminates a few more; and assuming a British point of origin, which would be logical considering the original source of the information and assuming from the increased pressure on you lately that the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the six thirty to Baltimore tomorrow evening from Heathrow Airport. Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing. John's expressed the same thought in every possible variant available to the English language. 
John, please can you check those flight schedules; see if I'm right? 
I've never begged for mercy in my life. 
What did you say? 
No, no, no, after that. What did you say after that? 
Double oh seven, double oh seven, double oh seven, double oh seven ... something ... something connected to double oh seven ... What? Double oh seven, double oh seven, what, what, something, what? 
Coventry. 
Where's John? 
I was just talking to him. 
It's a story, probably not true. In the Second World War, the Allies knew that Coventry was going to get bombed because they'd broken the German code but they didn't want the Germans to know that they'd broken the code, so they let it happen anyway. 
Sorry? 
I don't understand. 
Why? 
I'm not. 
Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn't hungry? 
That's not the end of the world; that's Mrs Hudson. 
Have you come to take me away again? 
Well, I decline. 
There's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet. The British and American governments know about it but rather than expose the source of that information they're going to let it happen. The plane will blow up. Coventry all over again. The wheel turns. Nothing is ever new. 
Well, you're lookin' all better. How ya feelin'? 
The plane blows up mid-air. Mission accomplished for the terrorists. Hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies. 
How's the plane going to fly? Of course: unmanned aircraft. Hardly new. 
Your MOD man. 
Hmm. You should screen your defence people more carefully. 
Don't be absurd. 
So do I. There are a number of aspects I'm still not quite clear on. 
There are four additional units wired inside the casing, I suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive. Any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive. 
There will be two passcodes: one to open the phone, one to burn the drive. Even under duress you can't know which one she's given you and there will be no point in a second attempt. 
No. 
I said no. Very very close, but no. You got carried away. The game was too elaborate. You were enjoying yourself too much. 
Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine, craving the distraction of the game - I sympathise entirely - but sentiment? Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side. 
You. 
No. Because I took your pulse. Elevated; your pupils dilated. I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple, and very destructive. When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe - your measurements; but this ... this is far more intimate. This is your heart ... and you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you've worked for ... but you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage ... Thank you for the final proof. 
I know. And this is just losing. There you are, brother. I hope the contents make up for any inconvenience I may have caused you tonight. 
If you're feeling kind, lock her up; otherwise let her go. I doubt she'll survive long without her protection. 
Yes. 
Sorry about dinner. 
Clearly you've got news. If it's about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener. Nobody noticed the earring. 
Oh? Something happened? Has she come back? 
Is she back in London? 
America? 
I know what? 
Why would I want to see her again? 
Is that her file? 
No. 
Oh, but I will have the camera phone, though. 
I know, but I ... I'll still have it. 
Please. Thank you. 
Yes. 
Once, a few months ago. 
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes." 
When I say run, run! 
The Woman. The Woman. 
Well, that was tedious. 
None of the cabs would take me. 
Nothing? 
Hmm. 
Nothing of importance? Oh, God! John, I need some. Get me some. 
Get me some. 
Stupid idea. Whose idea was that? Mrs Hudson! 
Tell me where they are. Please. Tell me. Please. 
I'll let you know next week's lottery numbers. Oh, it was worth a try. 
My secret supply. What have you done with my secret supply? 
Cigarettes! What have you done with them? Where are they? 
I thought you weren't my housekeeper. 
I need something stronger than tea. Seven per cent stronger. You've been to see Mr Chatterjee again. 
Sandwich shop. That's a new dress, but there's flour on the sleeve. You wouldn't dress like that for baking. 
Thumbnail: tiny traces of foil. Been at the scratch cards again. We all know where that leads, don't we? Mmm: 'Kasbah Nights.' Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning, wouldn't you agree? I've written a little blog on the identification of perfumes. It's on the website - you should look it up. 
I wouldn't pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr Chatterjee. He's got a wife in Doncaster that nobody knows about. 
Well, nobody except me. 
You don't understand. 
Apologise? 
Oh, John, I envy you so much. 
Your mind: it's so placid, straightforward, barely used. Mine's like an engine, racing out of control; a rocket tearing itself to pieces trapped on the launch pad. I need a case! 
That was this morning! When's the next one? 
"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes. I can't find Bluebell anywhere. Please please please can you help?" 
A rabbit, John! 
Ah, but there's more! Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous ... "like a fairy" according to little Kirsty; then the next morning, Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry ... Ah! What am I saying? This is brilliant! Phone Lestrade. Tell him there's an escaped rabbit. 
It's this, or Cluedo. 
Why not? 
Well, it was the only possible solution. 
Then the rules are wrong! 
Maximum pressure just under the half second. 
Client. 
What did you see? 
Yes, in a TV interview. I prefer to do my own editing. 
But quite quickly. 
No. 
Mmm, not interested. Moving on. 
Yes, good. Skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed. Where did that happen? 
So? 
Or a genetic experiment. 
Why, are you joking? 
And, I assume, did wonders for Devon tourism. 
Because of what happened last night. 
I didn't know; I noticed. You came up from Devon on the first available train this morning. You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee. The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you. Although you were initially keen, you've now changed your mind. You are, however, extremely anxious to have your first cigarette of the day. Sit down, Mr Knight, and do please smoke. I'd be delighted. 
Punched-out holes where your ticket's been checked ... 
Oh please. I've been cooped up in here for ages. 
Of course. I am a show-off. That's what we do. The train napkin that you used to mop up the spilled coffee: the strength of the stain shows that you didn't take milk. There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve. Cooked breakfast - or the nearest thing those trains can manage. Probably a sandwich. 
Is there any other type of breakfast on a train? The girl - female handwriting's quite distinctive. Wrote her phone number down on the napkin. I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you on the other side of the aisle. Later - after she got off, I imagine - you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee, accidentally smudging the numbers. You've been over the last four digits yourself with another pen, so you wanted to keep the number. Just now, though, you used the napkin to blow your nose. Maybe you're not that into her after all. Then there's the nicotine stains on your fingers ... your shaking fingers. I know the signs. No chance to smoke one on the train; no time to roll one before you got a cab here. It's just after nine fifteen. You're desperate. The first train from Exeter to London leaves at five forty-six a.m. You got the first one possible, so something important must have happened last night. Am I wrong? 
It's my job. Now shut up and smoke. 
His therapist. 
Obviously. 
And what happened when you went back to Dewer's Hollow last night, Henry? You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you're consulting a detective. What did you see that changed everything? 
Yes, if I wanted poetry I'd read John's emails to his girlfriends. Much funnier. What did you see? 
Is that it? Nothing else. Footprints. Is that all? 
No, sorry, Doctor Mortimer wins. Childhood trauma masked by an invented memory. Boring! Goodbye, Mr Knight. Thank you for smoking. 
Oh, they're probably paw prints; could be anything, therefore nothing. Off to Devon with you; have a cream tea on me. 
Say that again. 
No, no, no, your exact words. Repeat your exact words from a moment ago, exactly as you said them. 
I'll take the case. 
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It's very promising. 
It's nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren't listening. Baskerville: ever heard of it? 
Sounds like a good place to start. 
No, I can't leave London at the moment. Far too busy. Don't worry - putting my best man onto it. Always rely on John to send me the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself. 
Bluebell, John! I've got Bluebell! The case of the vanishing, glow-in-the-dark rabbit! NATO's in uproar. 
I don't need those any more. I'm going to Dartmoor. You go on ahead, Henry. We'll follow later. 
Twenty year old disappearance; a monstrous hound? I wouldn't miss this for the world! 
Mmm. Wait 'til she finds out about the one in Islamabad. Paddington Station, please. 
What's that? 
Clearly. 
I'm cold. 
Mind if I join you? It's not true, is it? You haven't actually seen this ... hound thing.
No, nothing like that. Just curious. Have you seen it? 
Got any proof? 
Bet's off, John, sorry. 
My plan needs darkness. Reckon we've got another half an hour of light ... 
Oh, I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn't prove you'd seen the hound. 
Yeah? 
I see. No witnesses, I suppose. 
Never are. 
Is that it? It's not exactly proof, is it? Sorry, John. I win. 
Ooh! Is it haunted?(!) Is that supposed to convince me? 
A clone, a super-dog?(!) 
Is that the best you've got? 
It's not specific to this place. It's my brother's. Access all areas. I, um ... acquired it ages ago, just in case. 
What's the matter? 
No we won't - well, not just yet. 
Thank you. 
I've told you - he practically is the British government. I reckon we've got about twenty minutes before they realise something's wrong.
"Are we in trouble, sir?"
You were expecting us?
Well, I hope not, Corporal, I hope not.
Nice touch.
Enjoy it?
How many animals do you keep down here?
Any ever escape?
Unless they have help.
Stapleton.
We're to be accorded every courtesy, Doctor Stapleton. What's your role at Baskerville?
Oh, you most certainly are free ... and I suggest you remain that way.
Stapleton. I knew I knew your name.
People say there's no such thing as coincidence. What dull lives they must lead.
Why did Bluebell have to die, Doctor Stapleton?
Disappeared from inside a locked hutch, which was always suggestive.
Clearly an inside job.
Why? Because it glowed in the dark.
Well, I think we've seen enough for now, Corporal. Thank you so much.
That's it. It's this way, isn't it?
Twenty-three minutes. Mycroft's getting slow.
Deeply; hugely.
I'm so sorry, Major.
New policy. Can't remain unmonitored forever. Goodness knows what you'd get up to. Keep walking.
Ah, well ...
Vienna.
Thank you.
That wasn't my hat.
It wasn't my hat.
You know Henry Knight?
I never did ask, Doctor Frankland. What exactly is it that you do here?
That would be tremendously ambitious of you. Tell me about Doctor Stapleton.
Yet you'd speak well of one, which you're clearly omitting to do.
I'll be in touch.
So?
Do what?
... I don't do that.
Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation.
Probably a fluorescent gene removed and spliced into the specimen. Simple enough these days.
So we know that Doctor Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals. The question is: has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit?
"Liberty in death" - isn't that the expression? The only true freedom.
Yes.
We take you back out onto the moor ...
... and see if anything attacks you.
That should bring things to a head.
Mmm.
Got any better ideas?
Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there's only one thing to do: find out where it lives.
Met a friend of yours.
Doctor Frankland.
Seems pretty concerned about you.
He knew your father.
But he works at Baskerville. Didn't your dad have a problem with that?
What about us?
No. I didn't see anything.
I didn't. See. Anything.
Henry's right.
I saw it too.
I saw it too, John.
A hound, out there in the Hollow. A gigantic hound.
Once you've ruled out the impossible, whatever remains - however improbable - must be true.
Look at me. I'm afraid, John. Afraid.
Always been able to keep myself distant ... divorce myself from ... feelings. But look, you see ... body's betraying me. Interesting, yes? Emotions. The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment.
Worked ... up?
Me?! There's nothing wrong with me.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? You want me to prove it, yes? We're looking for a dog, yes, a great big dog, that's your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien. Good, excellent, yes, where shall we start? How about them? The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman. The answer's yes.
She's got a West Highland terrier called Whisky. Not exactly what we're looking for.
Look at the jumper he's wearing. Hardly worn. Clearly he's uncomfortable in it. Maybe it's because of the material; more likely the hideous pattern, suggesting it's a present, probably Christmas. So he wants into his mother's good books. Why? Almost certainly money. He's treating her to a meal but his own portion is small. That means he wants to impress her, but he's trying to economise on his own food.
No, small plate. Starter. He's practically licked it clean. She's nearly finished her pavlova. If she'd treated him, he'd have had as much as he wanted. He's hungry all right, and not well-off - you can tell that by the state of his cuffs and shoes. "How d'you know she's his mother?" Who else would give him a Christmas present like that? Well, it could be an aunt or an elder sister, but mother's more likely. Now, he was a fisherman. Scarring pattern on his hands, very distinctive - fish hooks. They're all quite old now, which suggests he's been unemployed for some time. Not much industry in this part of the world, so he's turned to his widowed mother for help. "Widowed?" Yes, obviously. She's got a man's wedding ring on a chain round her neck - clearly her late husband's and too big for her finger. She's well-dressed but her jewellery's cheap. She could afford better, but she's kept it - it's sentimental. Now, the dog ... tiny little hairs all over the leg from where it gets a little bit too friendly, but no hairs above the knees, suggesting it's a small dog, probably a terrier. In fact it is - a West Highland terrier called Whisky. "How the hell do you know that, Sherlock?" 'Cause she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name and that's not cheating, that's listening. I use my senses, John, unlike some people, so you see, I am fine, in fact I've never been better, so just Leave. Me. Alone.
I don't have friends.
Morning! Oh, how are you feeling? 
That's a shame. Shall I make you some coffee? Oh look, you've got damp! 
Hound. 
Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound? 
It's odd, isn't it? Strange choice of words - archaic. It's why I took the case. "Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound." Why say "hound"? 
Actually, I'd better skip the coffee. 
Did you, er, get anywhere with that Morse code? 
U, M, Q, R, A, wasn't it? UMQRA. 
U.M.Q... 
Sure? 
How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her? 
Too bad. Did you get any information? 
Thought it might break the ice a bit. 
John ... 
No, wait. What happened last night ... Something happened to me; something I've not really experienced before ... 
No-no-no, it was more than that, John. It was doubt. I felt doubt. I've always been able to trust my senses, the evidence of my own eyes, until last night. 
No, I can't believe that. But I did see it, so the question is: how? How? 
Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it. I don't have friends. I've just got one. 
John? John! You are amazing! You are fantastic! 
You've never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable. 
Some people who aren't geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others. 
But what if it's not a word? What if it is individual letters? 
Absolutely no idea but ... What the hell are you doing here? 
No, I wouldn't. 
I'm waiting for an explanation, Inspector. Why are you here? 
You're brown as a nut. You're clearly just back from your 'holidays.' 
Oh, this is Mycroft, isn't it? 
Of course it is! One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to ... to spy on me incognito. Is that why you're calling yourself Greg? 
Is it? 
Why? 
Excellent. 
Coffee. I made coffee. 
I just did. Don't you want it? 
"Was"? 
No reason not to. 
Looks like it. 
No. It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John. Its whole body was glowing. I've got a theory but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it. 
Might not have to. Hello, brother dear. How are you? 
I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside. 
Which means you'll have to start the search for the hound. 
In the labs; Stapleton's first. Could be dangerous. 
It's a simple enough request, Major. 
You're to give me twenty-four hours. It's what I've ... negotiated. 
Perhaps the truth. 
Have you got any of those? Oh, just wondering. 
Where are you? 
John? John? 
All right, I'll find you. Keep talking. 
Keep talking. What are you seeing? John? 
What can you see? 
Stay calm, stay calm. Can you see it? Can you see it? 
Are you all right? John ... 
It's all right. It's okay now. 
Well, let's not jump to conclusions. 
What did you see? 
Huge; red eyes? 
Glowing? 
No. 
I made up the bit about glowing. You saw what you expected to see because I told you. You have been drugged. We have all been drugged. 
Can you walk? 
Come on, then. It's time to lay this ghost. 
Murder, Doctor Stapleton. Refined, cold-blooded murder. Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I? 
Can I borrow your microscope? 
It's not there! 
Nothing there! Doesn't make any sense. 
A drug, of course. There has to be a drug - a hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind. There's no trace of anything in the sugar. 
The sugar, yes. It's a simple process of elimination. I saw the hound - saw it as my imagination expected me to see it: a genetically engineered monster. But I knew I couldn't believe the evidence of my own eyes, so there were seven possible reasons for it, the most possible being narcotics. Henry Knight - he saw it too but you didn't, John. You didn't see it. Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen apart from one thing: you don't take sugar in your coffee. 
I took it from Henry's kitchen - his sugar. It's perfectly all right. 
No, it has to be a drug. But how did it get into our systems. How? There has to be something ... something ... ah, something ... something buried deep. Get out. 
Get out. I need to go to my mind palace. 
John. 
Project HOUND. Must have read about it and stored it away. An experiment in a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana. H, O, U, N, D. 
Password, password, password. He sat here when he thought it up. Describe him to me. 
But describe him. 
Good, excellent. Old-fashioned, traditionalist; not the sort that would use his children's names as a password. He loves his job; proud of it and this is work-related, so what's at eye level? Books. Jane's Defence Weekly - bound copies. Hannibal; Wellington; Rommel; Churchill's "History of the English-Speaking Peoples" - all four volumes. Churchill - well, he's fond of Churchill. Copy of "The Downing Street Years"; one, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher. Mid 1980s at a guess. Father and son: Barrymore senior. Medals: Distinguished Service Order. 
Right. So Thatcher's looking a more likely bet than Churchill. 
No. With a man like Major Barrymore, only first name terms would do. 
Project HOUND: a new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible. They wanted to use it as an anti-personnel weapon to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus; but they shut it down and hid it away in 1986. 
And what they did to others. Prolonged exposure drove them insane - made them almost uncontrollably aggressive. 
Attempting to refine it, perhaps, for the last twenty years. 
Five principal scientists, twenty years ago. Maybe our friend's somewhere in the back of the picture - someone who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986 ... Maybe somebody who says "cell phone" because of time spent in America. You remember, John? 
He gave us his number in case we needed him. 
It's where he started, though ... and he's never lost the certainty, the obsession that that drug really could work. Nice of him to give us his number. Let's arrange a little meeting. 
Henry? 
Gone? 
There's only one place he'll go to: back to where it all started. Lestrade. Get to the Hollow. ... Dewer's Hollow, now. And bring a gun. 
No, Henry, no! No! 
Yes, I'm sure you do, Henry. It's all been explained to you, hasn't it - explained very carefully. 
Someone needed to keep you quiet; needed to keep you as a child to reassert the dream that you'd both clung on to, because you had started to remember. Remember now, Henry. You've got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy. 
Henry, remember. "Liberty In." Two words; two words a frightened little boy saw here twenty years ago. You'd started to piece things together, remember what really happened here that night. It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry? Not a monster. A man. You couldn't cope. You were just a child, so you rationalised it into something very different. But then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped; driven out of your mind so that no-one would believe a word that you said. 
Yeah, but there was a dog, Henry, leaving footprints, scaring witnesses, but it was nothing more than an ordinary dog. We both saw it - saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it. Fear and stimulus; that's how it works. But there never was any monster. 
Henry, Henry ... 
All right! It's still here ... but it's just a dog. Henry! It's nothing more than an ordinary dog! 
No! It's not you! You're not here! The fog. 
It's the fog! The drug: it's in the fog! Aerosol dispersal - that's what it said in those records. Project HOUND - it's the fog! A chemical minefield! 
Look at it, Henry. 
Come on, look at it! 
Because dead men get listened to. He needed to do more than kill you. He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father, and he had the means right at his feet - a chemical minefield; pressure pads in the ground dosing you up every time that you came back here. Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once. Oh, this case, Henry! Thank you. It's been brilliant. 
What? 
Not good? 
Frankland! Frankland! 
It's no use, Frankland! 
So they didn't have it put down, then - the dog. 
I see. 
No, I don't. Sentiment? 
Oh. 
D'you want some sauce with that? 
You must have been dosed with it elsewhere, when you went to the lab, maybe. You saw those pipes - pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve; and they were carrying the gas, so ... Um, ketchup, was it, or brown ...? 
Better get going, actually. There's a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want ... 
I had to. It was an experiment. 
Shhh. 
I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee, then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore. It was all totally scientific, laboratory conditions - well, literally. 
Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one. You know what I mean. 
No, well, I wasn't to know you'd already been exposed to the gas. 
No. 
A bit. It won't happen again. 
None at all. You'll be fine once you've excreted it. We all will. 
Won't be a minute. Gotta see a man about a dog. 
Diamond cufflinks. All my cuffs have buttons. 
Do I? 
Thank you. 
Tie pin. I don't wear ties. 
Yes. 
Oh! 
"Boffin." "Boffin Sherlock Holmes." 
One what? 
Page five, column six, first sentence. Why is it always the hat photograph? 
What sort of hat is it anyway? 
Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? 
You stalk a deer with a hat? What are you gonna do - throw it? 
Some sort of death frisbee? 
It's got flaps ... ear flaps. It's an ear hat, John. What do you mean, "more careful"? 
Oh, it'll pass. 
It really bothers you. 
What people say. 
About me? I don't understand - why would it upset you? 
Mm. Keeps doing that. 
Oh. Henry Fishgard never committed suicide. Bow Street Runners: missed everything. 
They're all pressing 'til they're solved. 
Not now, I'm busy. 
Not now. 
Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
No. 
God forbid the star witness at the trial should come across as intelligent. 
I'll just be myself. 
Wrong toilet. 
Evidently. 
There are two types of fans. 
"Catch me before I kill again" - Type A ... 
"Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away." 
Neither. 
No. You're not a fan at all. Those marks on your forearm: edge of a desk. You've been typing in a hurry, probably. Pressure on; facing a deadline. 
And there's a smudge of ink on your wrist; and a bulge in your left jacket pocket. 
The smudge is deliberate, to see if I'm as good as they say I am. Hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print, but drawn on with an index finger; your finger. 
Journalist. Unlikely you'd get your hands dirty at the press. You put that there to test me. 
You mean I'd make a great feature: "Sherlock Holmes - the man beneath the hat." 
No. I'm just saving you the trouble of asking. No, I won't give you an interview; no, I don't want the money. 
And you think you're the girl for that job, do you? 
Smart, okay: investigative journalist. Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see. If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview. You can just read what you need. No? Okay, my turn. I look at you and I see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them. You're wearing an expensive skirt but it's been re-hemmed twice; only posh skirt you've got. And your nails: you can't afford to do them that often. I see someone who's hungry. I don't see smart, and I definitely don't see trustworthy, but I'll give you a quote if you like - three little words. You ... repel ... me. 
Yes. 
James Moriarty is for hire. 
Yes. 
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination, but I'm sure he'd make a pretty decent job of your boiler. 
Leading. 
Can't do that. You're leading the witness. He'll object and the judge will uphold. 
Ask me how. How would I describe him? What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this? 
First mistake. James Moriarty isn't a man at all - he's a spider; a spider at the centre of a web - a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances. 
No, no, don't-don't do that. That's really not a good question. 
How long have I known him? Not really your best line of enquiry. We met twice, five minutes in total. I pulled a gun; he tried to blow me up. I felt we had a special something. 
Two minutes would have made me an expert. Five was ample. 
Oh, really? One librarian; two teachers; two high-pressured jobs, probably the City. The foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad judging by her shorthand. 
Seven are married and two are having an affair - with each other, it would seem! Oh, and they've just had tea and biscuits. Would you like to know who ate the wafer? 
I can't just turn it on and off like a tap. Well? 
You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish. 
Moriarty's not mounting any defence. 
... he ended up in custody. 
Do what? 
Look? 
Well, I can't see it, can I? It's my face. 
Well, we do. 
If Moriarty wanted the Jewels, he'd have them. If he wanted those prisoners free, they'd be out on the streets. The only reason he's still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there. Somehow this is part of his scheme. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary, crimes which - if he's found guilty - will elicit a very long custodial sentence; and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. You must find him guilty. 
Guilty. 
Most people knock. But then you're not most people, I suppose. Kettle's just boiled. 
Please. 
... and the dying man jumped out of his bed, ran straight to the piano and finished it. 
Neither can you. That's why you've come. 
What, with the verdict? 
Got to the jury, of course. 
Cable network. 
So how're you going to do it ... burn me? 
I dunno. 
Told them what? 
No. 
Obviously. 
You want me to tell you what you already know? 
You didn't take anything because you don't need to. 
You'll never need to take anything ever again. 
Because nothing ... nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three. 
You were advertising all the way through the trial. You were showing the world what you can do. 
If you could break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder? 
Why are you doing all of this? 
You don't want money or power - not really. What is it all for? 
Never liked riddles. 
Kidnapping. 
Miss Mackenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night. What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal? Now quickly, tell me! 
I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly. Miss Mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now. 
Show me where the brother slept. The boy sleeps there every night, gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor. He'd recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door. 
So someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise, an intruder. Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon. What would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? How would he use them if not to cry out? This little boy; this particular little boy ... who reads all of those spy books. What would he do? 
Get Anderson. 
Linseed oil. 
Brilliant, Anderson. 
Yes. Brilliant impression of an idiot. The floor. 
The boy was made to walk ahead of them. 
Indicates anxiety; a gun held to his head. The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. He had his left arm cradled about her neck. 
You're right, Anderson - nothing. Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace. 
Starting to. 
He walked in when they weren't locked. 
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. Yesterday - end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. What's one more stranger among that lot? He was waiting for them. All he had to do was find a place to hide. 
Molly! 
No you're not. 
Cancel it. You're having lunch with me. 
Need your help. It's one of your old boyfriends - we're trying to track him down. He's been a bit naughty! 
Course it's Moriarty. 
Yes, and then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville. For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly. 
Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint - it'll lead us to Moriarty. All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we're lucky we can see everything that he's been up to. I need that analysis. 
Thank you, John. 
Yes. I ... owe ... you. Glycerol molecule. What are you? 
Nothing. Mental note. 
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation. It's really not your area. 
Molly ... 
But you can see me. 
What-what-what could I need from you? 
... Thank you. 
Well, actually, maybe I'll ... 
Hmm? 
What? 
Breadcrumbs. 
A little trace of breadcrumbs; hardback copy of fairy tales. Two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of breadcrumbs. 
The sort that likes to boast; the sort that thinks it's all a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ... 
All fairytales need a good old-fashioned villain. 
The fifth substance: it's part of the tale. The witch's house. 
The glycerol molecule. PGPR! 
It's used in making chocolate. 
Need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect. 
I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory. 
No. No-no-no. Too general. Need something more specific. Chalk; chalky clay - that's a far thinner band of geology. 
Building site. Bricks from the 1950s. 
I've got people out looking. 
Homeless network - faster than the police. Far more relaxed about taking bribes. John. Rhododendron ponticum. It matches. Addlestone. 
There's a mile of disused factories between the river and the park. It matches everything. 
This was alight moments ago. They're still here. Sweet wrappers. What's he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel. Mercury. 
The papers: they're painted with mercury. Lethal. The more of the stuff they ate ... 
But it's not enough to kill them on its own. Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them. He didn't need to be there for the execution. Murder by remote control. He could be a thousand miles away. The hungrier they got, the more they ate ... the faster they died. Neat. 
... not be myself. 
Claudette, I ... No-no, I know it's been hard for you ... Claudette, listen to me ... 
Thank you. 
Thinking. This is my cab. You get the next one. 
You might talk. 
Can you turn this off, please? 
Can you turn this off ... 
Stop the cab! Stop the cab! What was that? What was that? 
Thank you. 
He died because I shook his hand. 
He saved my life but he couldn't touch me. Why? 
Four assassins living right on our doorstep. They didn't come here to kill me; they have to keep me alive. I've got something that all of them want, but if one of them approaches me ... 
All of the attention is focussed on me. There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now. 
We need to ask about the dusting. 
Precise details: in the last week, what's been cleaned? 
No, in here, this room. This is where we'll find it - any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust. Dust is eloquent. 
Cameras. We're being watched. 
No, Inspector. 
The answer's no. 
You want to take me to the station. Just saving you the trouble of asking. 
The scream? 
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan. Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping? Ah, Moriarty is smart. He planted that doubt in her head; that little nagging sensation. You're going to have to be strong to resist. You can't kill an idea, can you? Not once it's made a home ... there. 
One photograph - that's his next move. Moriarty's game: first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me inch by inch. It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I'm willing to play. Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan. They'll be deciding. 
Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. 
Standard procedure. 
I don't care what people think. 
No, that would just make them stupid or wrong. 
That I am what? 
You're worried they're right. 
You're worried they're right about me. 
That's why you're so upset. You can't even entertain the possibility that they might be right. You're afraid that you've been taken in as well. 
Moriarty is playing with your mind too. Can't you see what's going on? 
A hundred percent? 
Burnt to a crisp. 
It's all right, John. 
Joining me? 
Hmm. Bit awkward, this. 
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape. 
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? NOW would be good! 
... my hostage. 
Doing what Moriarty wants - I'm becoming a fugitive. Run. 
Take my hand. 
Leave it! 
Go to your right. 
Go to your right. Everybody wants to believe it - that's what makes it so clever. A lie that's preferable to the truth. All my brilliant deductions were just a sham. No-one feels inadequate - Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man. 
A big family reconciliation? Now's not really the moment. 
That's not the police. It's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street. Let's see if he can give us some answers. 
We're going to jump in front of that bus. 
Tell me what you want from me. Tell me. 
Who? 
What? 
Of course. He's selling it - the programme he used to break into the Tower. He planted it when he came around. It's a game-changer. It's a key - it can break into any system and it's sitting in our flat right now. That's why he left that message telling everyone where to come. "Get Sherlock." We need to get back into the flat and search. 
It's another subtle way of smearing my name. Now I'm best pals with all those criminals. 
Too late to go on the record? 
Congratulations. The truth about Sherlock Holmes. The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo(!) 
And then, behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. How utterly convenient. Who is Brook? Oh, come on, Kitty. No-one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone. There are all those furtive little meetings in cafés; those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone. How do you know that you can trust him? A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets. What were his credentials? 
Stop it. Stop it NOW! 
No, no, no. He'll have back-up. 
He's got my whole life story. That's what you do when you sell a big lie; you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable. 
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for the last twenty-four hours. There's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game, and that's to ... 
Something I need to do. 
No - on my own. 
You're wrong, you know. You do count. You've always counted and I've always trusted you. But you were right. I'm not okay. 
Molly, I think I'm going to die. 
If I wasn't everything that you think I am - everything that I think I am - would you still want to help me? 
You. 
The computer code is key to this. If we find it, we can use it - beat Moriarty at his own game. 
He used it to create a false identity, so we can use it to break into the records and destroy Richard Brook. 
Somewhere in 221B, somewhere - on the day of the verdict - he left it hidden. 
An apple. Nothing else. 
No. 
What is it? 
What? How? 
You go. I'm busy. 
Thinking. I need to think. 
She's my landlady. 
Alone is what I have. Alone protects me. 
Richard Brook. 
Of course. 
Rich Brook in German is Reichen Bach - the case that made my name. 
Beats like digits. Every beat is a one; every rest is a zero. Binary code. That's why all those assassins tried to save my life. It was hidden on me; hidden inside my head - a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system. 
Yes, but now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records. I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty. 
But the rhythm ... 
But then how did ... 
Do it? Do - do what? Yes, of course. My suicide. 
I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity. 
You're insane. 
John. 
Mrs Hudson. 
Lestrade. 
... unless I kill myself - complete your story. 
And I die in disgrace. 
Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy? Please? 
"You're not going to do it." So the killers can be called off, then - there's a recall code or a word or a number. I don't have to die ... if I've got you. 
Yes. So do you. 
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember? I am you - prepared to do anything; prepared to burn; prepared to do what ordinary people won't do. You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you. 
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don't think for one second that I am one of them. 
John. 
Turn around and walk back the way you came now. 
Just do as I ask. Please. 
Stop there. 
Okay, look up. I'm on the rooftop. 
I ... I ... I can't come down, so we'll ... we'll just have to do it like this. 
An apology. It's all true. 
Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty. 
I'm a fake. 
The newspapers were right all along. I want you to tell Lestrade; I want you to tell Mrs Hudson, and Molly ... in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes. 
Nobody could be that clever. 
I researched you. Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you. It's a trick. Just a magic trick. 
No, stay exactly where you are. Don't move. 
Keep your eyes fixed on me. Please, will you do this for me? 
This phone call - it's, er ... it's my note. It's what people do, don't they - leave a note? 
Goodbye, John. 
Was that supposed to happen - the light going down? Yeah, okay.
Oh, er, mmm. So, what do I, what do I, what d'you want me to do at the end? Shall I, um ...? Smile and wink. I do that sometimes. I've no idea why. People seem to like it - humanises me.
Why am I doing this, again?
Of course I'm gonna miss dinner. There'll be people. How can John be having a birthday dinner? All his friends hate him. You only have to look at their faces. I wrote an essay on suppressed hatred in close proximity based entirely on his friends. On reflection, it probably wasn't a very good choice of gift. What was my excuse again?
Ah, right, yes! That's right. A thing.
No, no, no. Only lies have detail. Right, I just ... I need a moment to, um, figure out what I'm going to do.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready now. Hallo, John. I'm sorry I'm not there at the moment. I'm very busy. However, many happy returns. Oh, and don't worry. I'm going to be with you again very soon.
Moriarty's network - took me two years to dismantle it.
The Serbian side was the last piece of the puzzle.
Colossal.
Hmm.
What for?
"Wading in"? You sat there and watched me being beaten to a pulp.
No - I got me out. Why didn't you intervene sooner?
You were enjoying it.
Definitely enjoying it.
I didn't know you spoke Serbian.
Hmm - you're slipping.
What do you think of this shirt?
I will find your underground terror cell, Mycroft. Just put me back in London. I need to get to know the place again, breathe it in - feel every quiver of its beating heart.
And what about John Watson?
Mmm. Have you seen him?
No. Well, we'll have to get rid of that.
He looks ancient. I can't be seen to be wandering around with an old man.
I think I'll surprise John. He'll be delighted!
Hmm. I'll pop into Baker Street. Who knows - jump out of a cake.
What life? I've been away. Where's he going to be tonight?
You always know.
I think maybe I'll just drop by.
No it isn't. Now, where is it?
You know what.
Thank you ... blud.
Your wife just texted you. Possibly her contractions have started.
Sorry! I'm so, so sorry! Please, let me just go to the kitchen and, er, dry that off for you. Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you. Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu? It's, er, completely identical. Can I 'elp you with anything, sir?
Mmm! Well, these are all excellent vintages.
Well, you cannot possibly go wrong, but, erm, if you'd like my personal recommendation ...
... this last one on the list is a favourite of mine. It is - you might, in fact, say - like a face from ze past.
It is familiar, but, er, with the quality of surprise!
Certainly endeavouring to, sir.
Sir, I think you'll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking. It 'as all the qualities of the old, with some of the colour of the new.
Like a gaze from a crowd of strangers ... suddenly one is aware of staring into ze face of an old friend.
Interesting thing, a tuxedo. Lends distinction to friends, and anonymity to waiters.
Well, short version ... Not Dead. Bit mean, springing it on you like that, I know. Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will. But in my defence, it was very funny. Okay, it's not a great defence.
Oh yes.
Not quite.
No.
No. I'm quite sure. I checked. Excuse me. Does, er, does yours rub off, too? 
Okay, John, I'm suddenly realising I probably owe you some sort of an apology.
Wait - before you do anything that you might regret ... um, one question. Just let me ask one question. Um ... Are you really gonna keep that?!
I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I'd invited Moriarty onto the roof. I wanted to avoid dying if at all possible. The first scenario involved hurling myself into a parked hospital van filled with washing bags. Impossible. The angle was too steep. Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling ...
What?
Why? Because Moriarty had to be stopped. Oh. 'Why' as in ... I see. Yes. 'Why?' That's a little more difficult to explain.
Actually, um, that was mostly Mycroft's idea.
Mm-hm.
Couple of others. It was a very elaborate plan - it had to be. The next of the thirteen possibilities ...
Molly.
Molly Hooper - and some of my homeless network, and that's all.
No! Twenty-five at most.
Seriously, it's not a joke? You're-you're really keeping this?
You're sure?
Mmmmmm, no she doesn't.
She doesn't.
I've nearly been in contact so many times, but ... I worried that, you know, you might say something indiscreet.
Well, you know, let the cat out of the bag.
Over-reacting.
Shh!
Shh!
Shut up, John! I don't want everyone knowing I'm still alive!
Yes! It's still a secret. Promise you won't tell anyone.
London is in danger, John. There's an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help.
You have missed this. Admit it. The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world ...
I don't understand. I said I'm sorry. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
Mmm, nature? No. Human? ... No.
You will?
Those things'll kill you.
It's time to come back. You've been letting things slide, Graham.
Greg.
No, stay exactly where you are.
London. It's like a great cesspool into which all kinds of criminals, agents and drifters are irresistibly drained. Sometimes it's not a question of 'Who?'; it's a question of 'Who Knows?' If this man cancels his papers ... I need to know. If this woman leaves London without putting her dog into kennels, I need to know. There are certain people - they are markers. If they start to move, I'll know something's up - like rats deserting a sinking ship.
Boring. Your move.
"Solid information." A secret terrorist organisation's planning an attack - that's what secret terrorist organisations do, isn't it? It's their version of golf.
Oh, well, perhaps he shouldn't have done. He was obviously just trying to show off.
No, Mycroft, but you have to trust me. I'll find the answer. It'll be in an odd phrase in an online blog, or an unexpected trip to the countryside, or a misplaced Lonely Hearts ad. Your move.
I am on the case. We're both on the case. Look at us right now.
Oopsie! Can't handle a broken heart - how very telling.
That takes me back. "Don't be smart, Sherlock. I'm the smart one."
I used to think I was an idiot.
Oh, yes. That was a mistake.
Probably something about trying to make friends.
And you don't? Ever?
Yes, but I've been away for two years.
Oh, I don't know. I thought perhaps you might have found yourself a ... goldfish.
Rest assured, Mycroft - whatever this underground network of yours is up to, the secret will reside in something seemingly insignificant or bizarre.
Oh, he really can, you know.
Let's play something different.
Well, London's terror alert has been raised to Critical. I'm just passing the time. Let's do deductions. Client left this while I was out. What d'you reckon?
Oh, go on. It's been an age.
Which is why you can't resist.
Isolated, too, don't you think?
"He"?
Why? Size of the hat?
Some women have short hair, too.
Not that you've ever spoken to a woman with short hair - or, you know, a woman.
Five times. Very neatly. The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat, so he's mawkishly attached to it, but it's more than that. One, perhaps two, patches would indicate sentimentality, but five? Five's excessive behaviour. Obsessive compulsive.
Peru?
No.
Icelandic sheep wool. Similar, but very distinctive if you know what you're looking for. I've written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres.
You said he was anxious.
... but also a creature of habit because he hasn't chewed the bobble on the right.
Brief sniff of the offending bobble tells us everything we need to know about the state of his breath. Brilliant(!) 
But you've missed his isolation.
Plain as day.
There for all to see.
Plain as the nose on your ...
Well, anybody who wears a hat as stupid as this isn't in the habit of hanging around other people, is he?
Exactly.
He's different - so what? Why would he mind? You're quite right. Why would anyone mind?
How would you know?
Right. Back to work.
Mm?
I tried talking to him. He made his position quite clear.
F...
Yes. Molly?
Would you ... Would you like to ...
... solve crimes?
... monkey glands. But enough about Professor Presbury. Tell us more about your case, Mr Harcourt.
Absolutely.
If it makes you feel better.
You're not being John - you're being yourself.
Why didn't you assume it was your wife? 
No - it's because you emptied it. Weight loss, hair dye, Botox; affair. Lawyer. Next!
And your pen pal's emails just stopped, did they? And you really thought he was the one, didn't you? The love of your life? Stepfather posing as online boyfriend.
Breaks it off, breaks her heart. She swears off relationships, stays at home - he still has her wage coming in. Mr Windibank, you have been a complete and utter ...
Mmm. I don't doubt it.
Mm, maybe.
Shut up, John. 
Hmm? Nothing.
Just giving it a go.
Not really in the picture any more.
Trains.
Er, no, please. Be my guest.
Shut up! 
... six months old.
Hmm.
Mm-hm.
Welcome to my world.
Get out. I won't insult your intelligence by explaining it to you.
The-the-the corpse is-is six months old; it's dressed in a shoddy Victorian outfit from a museum. It's been displayed on a dummy for many years in a case facing south-east judging from the fading of the fabric. It was sold off in a fire-damage sale ... a week ago.
Yes.
Facile.
Why indeed, John?
No problem. So, what's this all about, Mr Shilcott?
Girlfriend?! Sorry. Do go on.
Yyyes.
He said he liked trains.
Bought off?
So if the driver of the train was in on it, then the passenger did get off.
I know that face.
The journey between those stations usually takes five minutes. That journey took ten minutes - ten minutes to get from Westminster to St James's Park. So I'm going to need maps - lots of maps, older maps, all the maps.
Fancy some chips?
I know a fantastic fish shop just off the Marylebone Road. The owner always gives me extra portions.
No - I helped him put up some shelves.
Hmm?
Saying thank you.
Everything you did for me.
No, I mean it.
Moriarty slipped up. He made a mistake. Because the one person he thought didn't matter at all to me was the one person that mattered the most. You made it all possible. But you can't do this again, can you?
Oh, congratulations, by the way.
I hope you'll be very happy, Molly Hooper. You deserve it. After all, not all the men you fall for can turn out to be sociopaths(!)
No.
Mary? What's wrong?
First word, then every third. Save ... John ... Watson. Now!
St James the Less. It's a church. Twenty minutes by car. Did you drive here?
It's too slow. It's too slow.
This.
I don't know.
Damn!
Oh my God.
Jump off! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! John!
John? John!
Hey, John.
So did you find it eventually, your lottery ticket?
John!
Er, no-no-no, they were just leaving.
Yes. 
No, not a case, no-no-no. Go. 'Bye.
Yes, great, wonderful. Just get out.
Very nice, yes, good. Get out.
Mm-hm.
Promise. Oh, for God... Sorry about that.
... Just my parents.
In town for a few days.
Mycroft promised to take them to a matinee of "Les Mis." Tried to talk me into doing it.
Yes.
What?
It's a cross I have to bear.
Hmm?
Maybe.
Sorry. Sorry again.
Sorry. See you've shaved it off, then.
Mm, I'm glad.
No. I prefer my doctors clean-shaven.
How are you feeling?
Right.
I don't know.
I don't know. I can't see the pattern. It's too nebulous. Why would an agent give his life to tell us something incredibly insignificant? That's what's strange.
According to Mycroft. There's an underground network planning an attack on London - that's all we know. These are my rats, John.
My markers: agents, low-lifes, people who might find themselves arrested or their diplomatic immunity suddenly rescinded. If one of them starts acting suspiciously, we know something's up. Five of them are behaving perfectly normally, but the sixth ...
Lord Moran, peer of the realm, Minister for Overseas Development. Pillar of the establishment.
He's been working for North Korea since 1996.
He's the Big Rat. Rat Number One. And he's just done something very suspicious indeed.
Not according to the maps.
There's something - something, something I'm missing, something staring me in the face.
Our rat's just come out of his den.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES! I've been an idiot - a blind idiot!
Oh, that's good. That could be brilliant.
Mycroft's intelligence - it's not nebulous at all. It's specific - incredibly specific.
Not an underground network, John. It's an Underground network.
Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can't see it even when it's staring you in the face. Look - seven carriages leave Westminster ... but only six carriages arrive at St James's Park.
Moran didn't disappear - the entire Tube compartment did. The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage.
Not on the maps, but once you eliminate all the other factors, the only thing remaining must be the truth. That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.
It vanishes between St James's Park and Westminster. Lord Moran vanishes. You're kidnapped and nearly burned to death at a fireworks par...  What's the date, John - today's date?
Lord Moran - he's a peer of the realm. Normally he'd sit in the House. Tonight there's an all-night sitting to vote on the new anti-terrorism Bill. But he won't be there. Not tonight. Not the fifth of November.
"Gunpowder treason and plot."
There has to be. Check again.
No, it's none of those. We've accounted for those. St Margaret's Street, Bridge Street, Sumatra Road, Parliament Street ...
It's right underneath the Palace of Westminster.
Must be.
What are you doing?
What? No!
They'll get in the way. They always do. This is cleaner, more efficient.
A bit. What are you doing?
I don't understand.
There's nowhere else it could be. Oh!
What?
Perfectly safe as long as we avoid touching the rails. 
This way.
Sure.
John.
Isn't there? This is the bomb.
It's not carrying explosives. The whole compartment is the bomb.
There may not be time for that now.
I have no idea.
Why d'you think I know what to do?
Doesn't mean I know how to defuse a giant bomb. What about you?
And a soldier, as you keep reminding us all.
That would set it off.
Er ...
Er ...
Please just ...
Well, it's no use now.
Go, John. Go now.
Hmm?
How will that help?
Oh, and you think I've just got "How To Defuse A Bomb" tucked away in there somewhere?
Maybe.
Um, er ...
Turn that off. Oh God! Er, um, er ... I'm sorry.
I can't ... I can't do it, John. I don't know how. Forgive me?
Please, John, forgive me ... for all the hurt that I caused you.
No.
No.
Not this time.
Yeah, well, be careful what you wish for. If I hadn't come back, you wouldn't be standing there and ... you'd still have a future ... with Mary.
I know.
The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast. Its roots were everywhere like a cancer, so we came up with a plan. Mycroft fed Moriarty information about me. Moriarty in turn gave us hints - just hints - as to the extent of his web. We let him go ... because it was important to let him believe he had the upper hand. And then I sat back and watched Moriarty destroy my reputation bit by bit. I had to make him believe he'd beaten me, utterly defeated me, and then he'd show his hand. There were thirteen likely scenarios once we were up on that roof. Each of them were rigorously worked out and given a code name. It wasn't just my reputation that Moriarty needed to bury - I had to die.
But the one thing I didn't anticipate was just how far Moriarty was prepared to go. I suppose that was obvious, given our first meeting at the swimming pool - his death wish. I knew I didn't have long. I contacted my brother; set the wheels in motion. And then everyone got to work.
It was vital that John stayed just where I put him. That way, his view was blocked by the ambulance station.
I needed to hit the airbag - which I did. Speed was paramount. The airbag needed to be got out of the way just as John cleared the station. But we needed him to see a body. That's where Molly came in. Like figures on a weather clock, we went one way, John went the other. Then our well-timed cyclist ... put John briefly out of action ... giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement. The rest was just window dressing. And one final touch ... a squash ball under the armpit. Apply enough pressure and it momentarily cuts off the pulse.
Everything was anticipated; every eventuality allowed for. It worked ... perfectly.
Yes. You remember the little girl who was abducted by Moriarty?
You assumed she reacted like that because I was her kidnapper. But I deduced Moriarty must have found someone who looked very like me to plant suspicion, and that that man - whoever he was - had to be got out of the way as soon as his usefulness ended. That meant there was a corpse in a morgue somewhere that looked just like me.
Molly found the body, faked the records, and I provided the other coat. I've got lots of coats.
Mycroft's men intervened before he could take the shot. He was invited to reconsider.
As I explained, the whole street was closed off ... like a scene from a play. Neat, don't you think?
What?
Oh really?
What?
Everyone's a critic. Anyway, that's not why I came.
No. I think you know why I'm here, Phillip. "How I Did It" by Jack the Ripper?
Lurid. A case so sensational, you hoped I'd be interested. But you overdid it, Phillip - you and your little 'fan club.'
But you didn't. You were always right. I wasn't dead.
Yeah. Of course you've wasted police time, perverted the course of justice, risked distracting me from a massive terrorist assault that could have both destroyed Parliament and caused the death of hundreds of people.
Oh, your face!
Your face!
I totally had you.
Oh, those things you said - such sweet things! I-I never knew you cared(!)
Scout's honour.
Ahh. 
There's an Off switch.
There's always an Off switch. Terrorists can get into all sorts of problems unless there's an Off switch.
I didn't lie altogether. I've absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off. Oh!
'Course I called the police.
Oh, please(!) Killing me - that's so two years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, brother dear, but you made a promise. There's nothing I can do to help.
In a minute.
Weddings - not really my thing.
Ready?
I'm not saying a word.
Hmm?
I don't know. I don't like not knowing. Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog, John, real life is rarely so neat. I don't know who was behind all this, but I will find out, I promise you.
Hmm?
Oh, don't be stupid.
Love what?
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
You know my methods, John. I am known to be indestructible.
I should hope so.
I know. I was there.
I heard you. Anyway, time to go and be Sherlock Holmes.
This is hard.
Really hard. Hardest thing I've ever had to do. Have you any funny stories about John?
I need anecdotes. Didn't go to any trouble, did you?
Shut up, Mrs Hudson.
You're formulating a question. It's physically painful watching you thinking.
It was me playing. I am composing.
I was road-testing.
Why are you here?
You bring me tea in the morning?
I don't know. I just thought it sort of happened.
Mm, I know. I have a list. Mycroft has a file.
What big day?
Two people who currently live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday and then carry on living together. What's big about that?
Mmm, no it doesn't.
Your husband was executed for double murder. You're hardly an advert for companionship. 
As does lethal injection. 
Aren't there usually biscuits?
Have the shops?
I'm sure the shop on the corner is open.
Mmm. Anyway, you've got things to do.
Biscuits.
You can if you like. She understands very little. Right, then. Into battle.
Oh, sorry.
Um, sorry?
Is it?
If that's the sort of thing you're looking for ... the man over there in blue is your best bet. Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat ... a barn conversion ... and a history of erectile dysfunction. Reviewing that information, possibly not your best bet.
Sorry - there was one more deduction there than I was expecting.
Let's talk about Mary, first.
Oh, I think you know what. You went out with her for two years.
Is that a fact? Whenever she tweets, you respond within five minutes regardless of time or current location, suggesting you have her on text alert. In all your Facebook photographs of the happy couple, Mary takes centre frame whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded.
You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions. Do you have anything to say in your defence? I think from now on we'll downgrade you to 'casual acquaintance.' No more than three planned social encounters a year, and always in John's presence. I have your contact details. I will be monitoring.
High-functioning sociopath ... with your number.
Mm, yes, um, well done in the service, Archie.
Um ...
Basically it's a cute smile to the bride's side, cute smile to the groom's side and then the rings.
And you have to wear the outfit.
You really do have to wear the outfit.
Grown-ups like that sort of thing.
... I don't know. I'll ask one.
Yep. 
Sure. Loads.
Yeah, all right. 
Maggots.
Mm!
Er, yes ... if he's good.
Lovely little village.
Traces of two leading brands of deodorant, both advertised for their strength, suggestive of a chronic body odour problem manifesting under stress.
Long-term relationship, compulsive cheat.
Waterproof cover on his smartphone. Yet his complexion doesn't indicate outdoor work. Suggests he's in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him, which means he often receives texts and emails he'd rather went unseen.
D'you like solving crimes?
So that's him. Major Sholto.
If they're such good friends, why does he barely even mention him?
About him?
Yes, but it's definitely him that he talks about?
I've never even heard him say his name.
Yes.
He is? He's the most unsociable?
Ah, that's why he's bouncing round him like a puppy.
Stop smiling.
Why are you out of breath?
Either I've caught you in a compromising position or you've been working out again. I favour the latter.
I need your answer, Mycroft, as a matter of urgency.
Even at the eleventh hour it's not too late, you know.
Cars can be ordered, private jets commandeered.
What a shame. Mary and John will be extremely d...
Oh, I don't know. There should always be a spectre at the feast.
What do you mean?
No, I don't understand.
No, no, no - I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter. What?
I know that silence. What?
What?
Mycroft!
Involved? I'm not involved.
John asked me to be his best man. How could I say no?
I'm not involved!
I will.
I'm not a child any more, Mycroft.
Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends ... and ... erm ... others. Er ... w...  A-a-also ...
Right, um ... First things first. Telegrams. Well, they're not actually telegrams. We just call them telegrams. I don't know why. Wedding tradition. ... because we don't have enough of that already, apparently. "To Mr and Mrs Watson. So sorry I'm unable to be with you on your special day. Good luck and best wishes, Mike Stamford."
"To John and Mary. All good wishes for your special day. With love and many big ... big squishy cuddles, from Stella and Ted."  "Mary - lots of love, ... poppet ... Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from CAM. Wish your family could have seen this."
Um, "special day" ... "very special day" ... "love" ... "love" ... "love" ... "love" ... "lo..."; bit of a theme - you get the general gist. People are basically fond.  John Watson. My friend, John Watson. John. When John first broached the subject of being best man, I was confused.
What was that noise downstairs?
Sounded like she was torturing an owl.
Could have been both.
Just occupying myself. Sometimes, it's so-o-o hard not smoking. Oh.
Er, be my guest. Tea? 
Mm-hm.
The best man?
Billy Kincaid.
Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter. Best man I ever knew. Vast contributions to charity, never disclosed. Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children's homes in north England. Yes, every now and again there'd be some garrottings, but stacking up the lives saved against the garrottings, on balance I'd say ...
Oh, right.
Gavin?
Gavin Lestrade? He's a man, and good at it.
Oh, Mike Stamford, I see. Well, he's nice, um, though I'm not sure how well he'd cope with all ...
Well ...
Yes.
Yes.
I confess at first I didn't realise he was asking me. When finally I understood, I expressed to him that I was both flattered and ... surprised.
I explained to him that I'd never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it.
I nonetheless promised that I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was - for me - as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated. Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he'd placed in me and indicated that I was, in some ways, very close to being ... moved by it.
It later transpired that I had said none of this out loud.
So, in fact ... You-you mean ...
I'm your ... best ...
... friend?
Surprisingly okay.
Done that. ... Done that ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Done that bit ... Hmm ... I'm afraid, John, I can't congratulate you. All emotions, and in particular love, stand opposed to the pure, cold reason I hold above all things. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world. Today we honour the death-watch beetle that is the doom of our society and, in time - one feels certain - our entire species. But anyway ... let's talk about John.
If I burden myself with a little help-mate during my adventures, it is not out of sentiment or caprice - it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me. Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes, in truth, from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides. It is a fact, I believe, that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there, I feel. ... and contrast is, after all, God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot. The point I'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. I am dismissive of the virtuous ... unaware of the beautiful ... and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody's best friend. Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing. John, I am a ridiculous man ... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. But, as I'm apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion. Actually, now I can. Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable. John, you have endured war, and injury, and tragic loss ... so sorry again about that last one ... so know this: today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved - in short, the two people who love you most in all this world. And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down, and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that.
Ah, yes. Now on to some funny stories about John ... What's wrong? What happened? Why are you all doing that? John?
Did I do it wrong?
I haven't finished yet.
So, on to some funny stories ...
So, on to some funny stories about John. If you could all just cheer up a bit, that would ... be better. On we go. So, for funny stories one has to look no further than John's blog.
The record of our time together. Of course, he does tend to romanticise things a bit, but then, you know ... he's a romantic. We've tackled some strange cases: the Hollow Client ...
... the Poison Giant ...
Get down, John! 
We've had some frustrating cases ...
A French decathlete found completely out of his mind, surrounded by one thousand, eight hundred and twelve matchboxes - all empty except this one.
The inexplicable.
... 'touching' cases ...
She's a client. She's boring. I've seen those symptoms before.
Oscillation on the pavement always means there's a love affair.
... and of course I have to mention the elephant in the room.
But we want something ... very particular for this special day, don't we? The Bloody Guardsman.
Need to work on your half of the church, Mary. Looking a bit thin.
Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely 11.48.
Calm? I am calm. I'm extremely calm.
Hmm. Hates you. Can't even bear to think about you.
Second class post, cheap card ... bought at a petrol station. Look at the stamp: three attempts at licking. She's obviously unconsciously retaining saliva.
Oh yes.
Done.
Major James Sholto. Who he?
Identical triplets - one in half a million births. Solved it without leaving the flat. Now, serviettes. Swan, or Sydney Opera House?
Many unexpected skills required in the field of criminal investigation ...
I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of ...
Okay - I learned it on YouTube.
That just sort of ... happened.
Lilac.
Pick what?
You want to go out on a case? N-now?
Don't you worry about a thing. I'll get you out of this. Oh.
Uniform fetishist. "All the nice girls like a soldier."
"Elite Guard."
Why this particular Grenadier? Curious.
Okay.
... ties.
... tie.
Just going to take him out for a bit - run him.
Mm.
Coming. Taxi!
And when will that be?
Do you think they give them classes?
How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds?
Oh! So why don't you see him any more?
Your previous commander, Sholto.
I meant "ex."
Which you don't.
'Course you don't. He was decorated, wasn't he? A war hero.
"Crows"?
Oh, I wouldn't count on that.
I'm ... chatting. Won't be trying that again.
Oh, good.
Wasn't worried.
Kill him with what? Where's the weapon?
Where's the weapon? Go on, search me. No weapon.
No.
He's soaking wet and there's still shampoo in his hair. He got into the shower and then someone stabbed him.
Well then I'd be soaking wet too, wouldn't I?
No. The weapon again - no knife.
Man stabbed to death. No murder weapon. Door locked from the inside. Only one way in or out of here.
Mmm?
What do we do?
What?
"Nurse"?
Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty. He'd stood there for hours, plenty of people watching, nothing apparently wrong. He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach, but there was no weapon. Where did it go? Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to consider this: a murderer who can walk through walls, a weapon that can vanish - but in all of this there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable. Would anyone like to make a guess? Come on, come on, there is actually an element of Q and A to all of this. Scotland Yard. Have you got a theory? Yeah, you. You're a detective - broadly speaking. Got a theory?
Brilliant.
No. Next!
Hello? Who was that? Tom. Got a theory?
A meat dagger.
No. There was one feature, and only one feature, of interest in the whole of this baffling case, and quite frankly it was the usual. John Watson - who, while I was trying to solve the murder, instead saved a life. There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling. The best and bravest man I know - and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff. ... except wedding planning and serviettes - he's rubbish at those.
The case itself remains the most ingenious and brilliantly-planned murder - or attempted murder - I've ever had the pleasure to encounter; the most perfect locked-room mystery of which I am aware. However, I'm not just here to praise John - I'm also here to embarrass him, so let's move on to some ...
How was what done?
I'm afraid I don't know. I didn't solve that one. That's ... It can happen sometimes. It's very ... very disappointing. Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night. Of course there's hours of material here, but I've cut it down to the really good bits.
Mmmm, pub crawl - themed.
Lacks the personal touch. We're going to go for a drink in every street where we ...
Don't want to get ill. That would ruin it - spoil the mood.
I lack the practical experience. 
Occasionally.
No. No! You look ... well.
How's ... Tom?
Still? Good.
Okay. I want you to calculate John's ideal intake, and mine, to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening. Light-headed, good ...
Hmm.
Two, er ... beers, please.
Four hundred and forty-three point seven millilitres.
You'll thank me.
Cheers.
Over there.
Toilets. Any second now, you're going to ...
Mmm, on schedule.
Nothing - go! How long?
Your visit. If you could estimate approximate volume discharged ...
Thank you.
I know ash! Don't - Tell - Me - I - Don't!
Ashtray. I know ashtray.
I have an international reputation. Do you have an international reputation?
No. And I can't even remember what for. Sss... Crime ... something or other.
Ah, Hudders. What time is it?
You, or the thing?
Thank you.
No, you're not a vegetable.
Errr ... am I human?
Can't have 'sometimes.' Has to be, um ...
... 'yes' or 'no.' ... Okay. And am I a man?
Tall?
Hmm. Nice?
Clever?
You would? Mmm, am I important?
Do "people" ... like me?
Okay. Am I the current King of England?
Don't we?
Your go.
Yes.
Err ... Er, beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences and role models.
I don't know who you are. I don't know who you're supposed to be.
Ah, but I picked it at random from the papers.
So I am human, I'm not as tall as people think I am ... I'm-I'm nice-ish ... clever, important to some people, but I tend to rub them up the wrong way. Got it.
I'm you, aren't I?
Hallo!
Boring, boring, boring - no! Fascinating! John - John! Wake up! Apologies about my ... you know ... thing. Rude. Rude!
Don't worry. I'll find him in ten minutes. What's your dog's name?
John! Wake up! We're meant to ... The game's ... something.
Yeah, that, that!
Hmm?
Oh, errrrrr ... I'm just gonna whip this out. Mm-hmm?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What d'you think you're doing? Don't compromise the integrity of the ...
Yeah, that.
It was awful.
That woman, Tessa.
Dated a ghost. The most interesting case for months. What a wasted opportunity.
There are going to be others.
Victims, women. Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house - this ghost, however, is willing to commute, look.
Mmmmmm, not you. Not you. Not you. Not you. Not you.
[Transcriber's note: Your humble transcriber is so anally obsessed with the accuracy of her transcripts that normally she would type every single instance of what follows, carefully counting every "Not you" and the location of the woman to whom Sherlock says it. However, it would probably make for very boring reading and so for speed, convenience and the nurturing of very sore typing fingers, suffice it to say that this scene continues for a long time, with Sherlock dismissing woman after woman, each of whom sits down.]
Hi.
How did you meet?
Name?
His name.
Your place?
Address?
Four women in four nights. He must have something special.
Not now, John. Sorry about that.
Different names, different addresses. Describe him.
He's stealing the identity of corpses ... getting the names from the Obituary columns. All single men. He's using the dead man's flat under the assumption it'll be empty for a while. Free love nest.
Hello, Tessa. Meanwhile, back to business. No-one wants to use a dead man's home. Least not until it's been cleared. So, he disguises himself, steals the man's home, steals his identity.
He's not a ghost, John. He's a mayfly. He lives for a day. So - what was it he was looking for? Job.
Obvious. You all work for the same person! No, not the same employer. Damn. Come on. We can do this. Ideal night out.
Make-up.
Perfume.
Ideal man?
Oh, no.
There's a unifying factor. There has to be. None of you reported anything stolen. Security guard, gardener, cook, maid, private nurse. He's romancing his way up a pecking order, somebody's pecking order. Come on, think. Unless ... Do you have a secret you've never told anyone?
Gotcha.
Everyone has secrets, and they all replied too quickly.
No!
Wait!
Why? Why would he date all of those women and not return their calls?
Am I?
But why would he change his identity?
Ohh.
Married. Obvious, really. Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity ... and instead of endless nights in watching the telly or going to barbecues with awful dreadful boring people he couldn't stand, he used his wits, cleverness and powers of disguise ... to play the field. He was ... On second thoughts I probably should have told you about the Elephant in the Room. However, it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me. I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being. I used to think that's what made me special - quite frankly, I still do. But a word to the wise: should any of you require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder, but it takes John Watson to save your life. Trust me on that - I should know. He's saved mine so many times, and in so many ways. This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures ... of murder, mystery and mayhem. But from now on, there's a new story - a bigger adventure. Ladies and gentlemen, pray charge your glasses and be upstanding. Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson. The two reasons why every single one of us is ...
What did you say? You said, "John Hamish Watson." You said that. You said, "Hamish."
... whoa, whoa!
How did you know? How did you know his middle name? He never tells anyone. He hates it.
"John H. Watson"?
Henry?
Humphrey?
Higgins?
Took him years to confide in me. 
Yep.
And The Woman - she knew.
God knows where she is. Out of my head. I am busy. There's only one time that name's been made public.
It's funny.
The wedding. You knew about the wedding; more importantly, you'd seen a wedding invitation. Now barely a hundred people had seen that invitation. The Mayfly Man only saw five women. For one person to be in both groups ... could be a coincidence.
The universe is rarely so lazy.
Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding.
They lied, assumed false identities.
Criminal intent.
Intelligence, planning.
The Mayfly Man. The Mayfly Man is ...
... here today. Ooh, sorry. I ...
Thank you, yes. Thank you, yes.
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Raising glasses and standing up. Very good. Thank you.
And down again. Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you not to milk a good speech - get off early, leave 'em laughing. Wise advice I'll certainly try to bear in mind. But for now ... part two. Part two is more action-based. I'm gonna ... walk around, shake things up a bit. Who'd go to a wedding? That's the question. Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding? Well, everyone. Weddings are great! Love a wedding.
And John's great, too! Haven't said that enough. Barely scratched the surface. I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his ... jumpers ... and he can cook. Does ... a ... thing ... thing with peas ... once. Might not be peas. Might not be him. But he's got a great singing voice ... or somebody does. Ahh, too many, too many, too many, too many! Sorry. Too many jokes about John! Now, er ...
Where was I? Ah, yes ...
Speech! Speech. Let's talk about ...
... murder. Sorry, did I say 'murder'? I meant to say 'marriage' - but, you know, they're quite similar procedures when you think about it. The participants tend to know each other, and it's over when one of them's dead. In fairness, murder is a lot quicker, though. Janine! What about this one? Acceptably hot? More importantly, his girlfriend's wearing brand-new uncomfortable underwear ... and hasn't bothered to pick this thread off the top of his jacket ... or point out the grease smudge on the back of his neck. Currently, he's going home alone. Also, he's a comics and sci-fi geek. They're always tremendously grateful - really put the hours in. Geoff, the gents. The loos, now, please.
The loos, please.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's your turn.
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, can't stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once, Vatican Cameos.
No! No! Not you! Not you! You. It's always you. John Watson, you keep me right.
Well, you've already done it. Don't solve the murder. Save the life. Sorry. Off-piste a bit. Back now. Phew! Let's play a game. Let's play Murder.
Imagine someone's going to get murdered at a wedding. Who exactly would you pick?
If someone could move Mrs Hudson's glass just slightly out of reach, that would be lovely. More importantly, who could you only kill at a wedding? Most people you can kill any old place. As a mental exercise, I've often planned the murder of friends and colleagues. Now John I'd poison. Sloppy eater - dead easy. I've given him chemicals and compounds - that way, he's never even noticed. He missed a whole Wednesday once, didn't have a clue. Lestrade's so easy to kill, it's a miracle no-one's succumbed to the temptation. I've got a pair of keys to my brother's house - I could easily break in there and asphyxiate him. ... if, if the whim arose.
TOHe's pissed, isn't he? Ow!
So, once again, who could you only kill here? Clearly it's a rare opportunity, so it's someone who doesn't get out much. Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception. Has to be a unique opportunity. And since killing someone in public is difficult ... killing them in private isn't an option. Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then. Someone private, perhaps, obsessed with personal security. Possibly someone under threat.
Ooh! A recluse, small household staff.
Job. 
High turnover for additional security.
Probably all signed confidentiality agreements.
Do you have a secret you've never told anyone?
There is another question that remains, however - a big one, a huge one: how would you do it? How would you kill someone in public? There has to be a way. This has been planned.
Oh, hello again, Archie. What's your theory? Get this right and there's a headless nun in it for you.
The who, the what, the why, the when, the where?
Oh, not just planned. Planned and rehearsed. Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interlude. The bride and groom!
Major Sholto's going to be murdered. I don't know how or by whom, but it's going to happen. 'Scuse me, coming through! Consulting!
I have to delete something!
Major Sholto? Major Sholto! Major Sholto!
You're not safe in there. Whoever's after you, we know that a locked room doesn't stop him.
I don't know how he does it, so I can't stop him, and that means he'll do it again.
I - I'm sorry?
Sorry?
If I couldn't solve it before, how can I solve it now?
What are you talking about? What's she talking about? Get your wife under control.
Oh, you've changed!
Though, in fairness, he's a drama queen too.
Major Sholto, no-one's coming to kill you. I'm afraid you've already been killed several hours ago.
Don't take off your belt.
His belt, yes. Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him, but it was through his belt. Tight belt, worn high on the waist. Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric and you wouldn't even feel it.
Exactly.
Delayed action stabbing. All the time in the world to create an alibi. Major Sholto?
Yes, I think we are.
Of course there is.
Of course one should, but not at John's wedding. We wouldn't do that, would we - you and me? We would never do that to John Watson.
One, two, three; der, der, der ... Ahh, pretty good.
Just ... hold your nerve on your turning.
Because we are about to dance together in public, and your skills are appalling!
Mmm.
I'll let you in on something, Janine.
I love dancing. I've always loved it.
Watch out.
Never really comes up in crime work but, um, you know, I live in hope of the right case.
I know.
One murder... - one nearly murderer. Loves to exaggerate. You should try living with him.
Ah, the photographer. Excellent! Thank you. Er, may I have a look at your camera?
You should have driven faster. Ah, yes. Yes, very good. There, you see? Perfect. 
Try looking yourself.
It's not what's in the photographs; it's what's not in them - not in any of them.
There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph but can go anywhere, and even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes, and you never even see his face. You only ever see ... the camera.
Jonathan Small, today's substitute wedding photographer - known to us as the Mayfly Man. His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion. Jonny sought revenge on Sholto, worked his way through Sholto's staff, found what he needed ... an invitation to a wedding - the one time Sholto would have to be out in public. So, he made his plan ... and rehearsed the murder ... making sure of every last detail. Brilliant, ruthless, almost certainly a monomaniac - though, in fairness, his photographs are actually quite good. Everything you need's on that. You probably ought to ... arrest him or something.
Down, girl.
Oh, I don't do the arresting. I just farm that out.
You should have driven faster.
Ladies and gentlemen, just, er, one last thing before the evening begins properly. Apologies for earlier. A crisis arose and was dealt with. More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows. I've never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will always be there, always, for all three of you. Er, I'm sorry, I mean, I mean two of you. All two of you. Both of you, in fact. I've just miscounted. Anyway, it's time for dancing. Play the music again, please, thank you. Okay, everybody, just dance. Don't be shy! Dancing, please! Very good! Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting.
Increased appetite ...
... change of taste perception ...
... and you were sick this morning. You assumed it was just wedding nerves. You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you. All the signs are there.
The signs of three.
Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test. W... th... the statistics for the first trimester are ...
Sorry.
It's your day off.
Stop-stop panicking.
Don't panic. None of you panic. Absolutely no reason to panic.
Yes, I would. You're already the best parents in the world. Look at all the practice you've had!
Well, you're hardly gonna need me around now that you've got a real baby on the way.
Dance.
Both of you, now, go dance. We can't just stand here. People will wonder what we're talking about.
Yes, there are.
Don't worry, Mary, I have been tutoring him.
Ah, hello, John. Didn't expect to see you here. Did you come for me, too?
For God's sakes, John! I'm on a case!
I'm working.
I'm undercover.
Well, I'm not now!
I was undercover.
Sorry your engagement's over - though I'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.
Please do relax. This is all for a case.
I might as well ask you why you've started cycling to work.
Quite recently, I'd say. You're very determined about it.
Yes. I think, in a way, it was.
I'm sorry?
Not bad.
No - he's always walked like that. Remind me - what's your name again?
No they don't.
Nope.
Nice observational skills, Billy. Ah! Finally.
Oh, excellent news - the best. There's every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers. The game is on. Excuse me for a second.
You've heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen, of course.
Hang on - weren't there other people?
People were talking, none of them me. I must have filtered.
I have to filter out a lot of witless babble. I've got Mrs Hudson on semi-permanent mute. What is my brother doing here? 
He's straightened the knocker. He always corrects it. He's OCD. Doesn't even know he's doing it.
Do what?
What are you doing here?
You phoned him.
"We"?
For God's sake! Anderson.
I do not have a drug habit. 
It was blocking my view to the kitchen.
Well, you were gone. I saw an opportunity.
There's nothing to find.
Okay, stop! Just stop. Point made.
This is not what you think. This is for a case.
Magnussen. Charles Augustus Magnussen.
Oh, you mean he's yours.
I consider you under his thumb.
Okay. I'll let you know if I notice. Er, what was I going to say? Oh, yeah. Bye-bye.
Brother mine, don't appal me when I'm high.
What time is it?
I'm meeting him in three hours. I need a bath.
Yep.
Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in.
God, no. Trying to recruit you. And stay out of my bedroom.
Morning.
So - it's just a guess but you've probably got some questions.
Naturally.
Yes, I have. Now, Magnussen. Magnussen is like a shark - it's the only way I can describe him. Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium, John - stood up close to the glass? Those floating flat faces, those dead eyes ... That's what he is. I've dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.
Sorry, what?
What? Yes! Yes, I'm going out with Janine. I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes, I am.
Mmm, yes. Me and Janine.
Well, we're in a good place. It's, um ... very affirming.
Everyone got that from a book.
Working.
Don't you go letting on.
Yeah!
Have a lovely day. Call me later.
You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he's so much more than that. He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power. I'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western world and probably beyond. He is the Napoleon of blackmail ... and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge. Its name ... is Appledore.
Sorry, what, dinner?
Seriously? I've just told you that the Western world is run from this house ... and you want to talk about dinner?
It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world ... the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals - and none of it is on a computer. He's smart - computers can be hacked. It's all on hard copy in vaults ... underneath that house; and as long as it is, the personal freedom of anyone you've ever met is a fantasy.
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, go ahead.
Oh, he's fine.
I can vouch for this man. He's a doctor. If you know who I am, then you know who he is ... don't you, Mr Magnussen? I understood we were meeting at your office.
Mr Magnussen, I have been asked to intercede with you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood on the matter of her husband's letters. Some time ago you ... put pressure on her concerning those letters. She would like those letters back. Obviously the letters no longer have any practical use to you, so with that in mind ... Something I said?
I ... I was trying to explain that I've been asked to act on behalf of ...
I've been asked to negotiate the return of those letters. I'm aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents ...
Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?
Mr Magnussen, am I acceptable to you as an intermediary?
Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did?
Exactly - when he showed us the letters.
So he's brought the letters to London - so no matter what he says, he's ready to make a deal. Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses - the 'pressure point,' he calls it. So, clearly he believes I'm a drug addict and no serious threat. And, of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of Great Britain from seven 'til ten.
Because I do. Right - I'll see you tonight. I've got some shopping to do.
I'll text instructions. 
You are! I checked!
Don't bring a gun.
Or a knife, or a tyre lever. Probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we'll see how the night goes.
Time you got out of the house, John. You've put on seven pounds since you got married, and the cycling isn't doing it.
Mary and I think seven. See you later. Hatton Garden.
Magnussen's office is on the top floor, just below his private flat ... but there are fourteen levels of security between us and him ... two of which aren't even legal in this country. Want to know how we're going to break in?
Of course it's what we're doing. Magnussen's private lift. It goes straight to his penthouse and office. Only he uses it ... and only his key card calls the lift. Anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed. Standard key card for the building. Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us as far as the canteen. Here we go, then. If I was to use this card on that lift now, what happens?
Exactly.
Do we really need so much colour?
But if I do this ... If you press a key card against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It's a common problem - never put your key card with your phone. What happens if I use the card now?
But it doesn't read as the wrong card now. It registers as corrupted. But if it's corrupted, how do they know it's not Magnussen?
Would they risk dragging him off?
So what do they do? What do they have to do?
There's a camera at eye height to the right of the door. A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen's personal staff in his office - the only people trusted to make a positive ID. ... at this hour, almost certainly his PA.
Human error. I've been shopping. Here we go, then.
Which, in this case, is a considerable advantage.
Hi, Janine. Go on, let me in.
Don't make me do it out here. Not ... in front of everyone. 
You see? As long as there's people, there's always a weak spot.
Yes, of course it was Janine. She's Magnussen's PA. That's the whole point.
Yeah. Stroke of luck, meeting her at your wedding. You can take some of the credit.
Yes. Like I said - human error.
Well, not actually marry her, obviously. There's only so far you can go.
Well, I'll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss' office. I imagine she'll want to stop seeing me at that point ... but you're the expert on women.
It's a bit rude. I just proposed to her.
Did she faint? Do they really do that?
Another in here. Security.
Ex-con. White supremacist, by the tattoo, so who cares? Stick with Janine.
So's Magnussen. His seat's still warm. He should be at dinner but he's still in the building. Upstairs!
During our own burglary?! You're really not a natural at this, are you? No, wait, shh! Perfume - not Janine's. Claire-de-la-lune. Why do I know it?
No, not Mary. Somebody else.
Additionally, if you're going to commit murder, you might consider changing your perfume ... Lady Smallwood.
He's, um ...
He-he's downstairs.
Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.
No, Mrs Watson. You won't.
Mary?
Blood loss.
Sorry?
That one, I think. Or that one.
(Young Sherlock) I'm not stupid.
(Young Sherlock) Why not?
(Young Sherlock) I've not been murdered yet.
The mirror shattering.
The bullet's still inside me.
What the hell is that? What's happening?
What do I do?
It's coming to get you.
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy. Come on! Come to me. It's okay. It's all right.
(Young Sherlock) Come on! It's me! It's me, come on!
Come on!
(Young Sherlock) Good boy! Clever boy!
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting me down too, now. It's no fun, is it? Redbeard.
Control! Control! Control. You. You never felt pain, did you? Why did you never feel pain?
John!
John!
Mary.
You didn't give these stories to Magnussen, did you?
And you - as it turns out - are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry tabloid whore.
Yeah, of course. Where's the cottage?
Hmm, nice.
How much more revenge are you gonna need?
Not good for working.
I exploited the fact of our connection.
Hmm?
Oh. I was waiting until we got married.
So ... Mary Watson. Who are you? Mary Watson.
Can't you see me?
The lie - the lie of Leinster Gardens - hidden in plain sight. Hardly anyone notices. People live here for years and never see it, but if you are what I think you are, it'll take you less than a minute. The houses, Mary. Look at the houses.
I knew you'd talk to the people no-one else would bother with.
You're always clever, Mary. I was relying on that. I planted the information for you to find.
Thirty seconds.
No door knobs, no letter box ... painted windows. Twenty-three and twenty-four Leinster Gardens ... the empty houses. They were demolished years ago to make way for the London Underground, a vent for the old steam trains. Only the very front section of the house remains. It's just a façade. Remind you of anyone, Mary? A façade. Sorry. I never could resist a touch of drama. Do come in. It's a little cramped.
Mmm. I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal. Nearly cost me my kidneys, but fortunately I had a ... straight flush. Quite a gambler, that woman.
Mary Morstan was stillborn in October 1972. Her gravestone is in Chiswick Cemetery where - five years ago - you acquired her name and date of birth and thereafter her identity. That's why you don't have 'friends' from before that date.
It's an old enough technique, known to the kinds of people who can recognise a skip-code on sight ...
... have extraordinarily retentive memories ...
How good a shot are you?
If I die here, my body will be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it. Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that. I want to know how good you are. Go on. Show me. The doctor's wife must be a little bit bored by now. May I see?
And yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot. Enough to hospitalise me; not enough to kill me. That wasn't a miss. That was surgery. I'll take the case.
Yours. Why didn't you come to me in the first place? 
Sorry. Not that obvious a trick. Now talk, and sort it out. Do it quickly.
I invited him.
No.
Closer.
Probably stop talking now.
Well, you know - they've had their ups and downs.
Baker Street. Now.
Get me some morphine from your kitchen. I've run out.
Then what exactly is the point of you?
The Watsons are about to have a domestic, and fairly quickly, I hope, because we've got work to do.
Yes. Good that we've settled that. Anyway, we ...
I didn't say it was funny.
Everything.
Oh, I mean it, seriously. Everything - everything you've ever done is what you did.
You were a doctor who went to war. You're a man who couldn't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den and beating up a junkie. Your best friend is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high. That's me, by the way. Hello. Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel.
And exotic dancing.
John, you are addicted to a certain lifestyle. You're abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people ... so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you've fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?
Because you chose her.
John, listen. Be calm and answer me. What is she?
No. What is she?
No. Not in this flat; not in this room. Right here, right now, what is she?
'A.G.R.A.' What's that?
By your skill set, you are - or were - an intelligence agent. Your accent is currently English but I suspect you are not. You're on the run from something; you've used your skills to disappear; Magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him; and I assume you befriended Janine ... in order to get close to him.
So ... Mary ... any documents that Magnussen has concerning yourself, you want ... extracted and returned.
Because ... you saved my life.
When I happened on you and Magnussen ... you had a problem. More specifically, you had a witness.
The solution, of course, was simple. Kill us both and leave. However, sentiment got the better of you. One precisely-calculated shot to incapacitate me ... in the hope that it would bide you more time to negotiate my silence. Of course, you couldn't shoot Magnussen. On the night that both of us broke into the building, your own husband would become a suspect, so ... you calculated ... that Magnussen ... would use the fact of your involvement rather than sharing the information with the police ... as is his M.O. ... and then you left the way you came. Have I missed anything?
She phoned the ambulance.
She phoned first. 
You didn't find me for another five minutes. Left to you, I would have died. The average arrival time for a London ambulance is ...
... eight minutes. Did you bring any morphine? I asked on the phone.
There was, last week ... but I believe I'm bleeding internally and my pulse is very erratic. You may need to re-start my heart on the way.
John? John - Magnussen is all that matters now. You can trust Mary. She saved my life.
Er, mixed messages, I grant you.
Are you?
Because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets. Why don't you?
A dragon slayer. Is that what you think of me?
It was Mycroft.
I decline your kind offer.
What was it?
Then why don't you want me to take it?
Utility(!) How do I have utility?
You need low tar. You still smoke like a beginner.
What the hell am I supposed to say to that?!
You hate Christmas.
Clearly. Go and have some more.
Don't drink Mary's tea. Oh, or the punch.
Don't worry. Wiggins is an excellent chemist. 
He'll monitor their recovery. It's more or less his day job.
... A deal with the devil.
I am in hospital. This is the canteen.
In my opinion, yes. Have a seat.
I've been thinking about you.
Really? I want to see Appledore, where you keep all the secrets, all the files, everything you've got on everyone. I want you to invite me.
Oh, I think you're a lot more 'careless' than you let on.
It's the dead-eye stare that gives it away. Except it's not dead-eyed, is it? You're reading. Portable Appledore. How does it work? Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless? They're just ordinary spectacles.
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.
A Christmas present.
My brother.
I'd rather keep you guessing. Ah. There's our lift.
Coming?
D'you want your wife to be safe?
Good, because this is going to be incredibly dangerous. One false move and we'll have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be in prison for high treason. Magnussen is quite simply the most dangerous man we've ever encountered, and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us.
I feel the same. Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas. Did you bring your gun as I suggested?
Is it in your coat?
Off we go, then.
Appledore.
Oh. It was you.
Mm.
It's an exchange, not a gift.
It's password protected. In return for the password, you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman I know as Mary Watson.
Then why don't you show us?
I want everything you've got on Mary.
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of that laptop ...
The fact that you know it's going to happen isn't going to stop it.
Let him. I'm sorry. Just ... let him.
To clarify: Appledore's vaults only exist in your mind, nowhere else, just there. 
Oh, do your research. I'm not a hero ... I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Merry Christmas!
Get away from me, John! Stay well back!
Give my love to Mary. Tell her she's safe now.
You will look after him for me, won't you?
That's my girl. Since this is likely to be the last conversation I'll have with John Watson ... would you mind if we took a moment?
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
That's the whole of it - if you're looking for baby names.
Oh. Okay.
No, neither can I.
The game is never over, John ... but there may be some new players now. It's okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end. 
It's a story my brother told me when we were kids. The East Wind - this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path. It seeks out the unworthy ... and plucks them from the Earth. That was generally me.
He was a rubbish big brother.
Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.
Six months, my brother estimates. He's never wrong. 
Who knows? John, there's something ... I should say; I-I've meant to say always and then never have. Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again, I might as well say it now. Sherlock is actually a girl's name.
It was worth a try.
I think it could work. To the very best of times, John.
Mycroft?
I've only been gone four minutes.
Oh, for God's sake. Make up your mind. Who needs me this time?
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive. 
Excellent reflexes. You'll do.
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park. Between us we could afford them.
I did. I mentioned to Stamford this morning I was in need of a fellow lodger. Now he appears after lunch in the company of a man of military aspect with a tan and recent injury, both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan and an enforced departure from it. The conclusion seemed inescapable.
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a hanging in Wandsworth and I'd hate them to start without me.
I take a professional interest. I also play the violin and smoke a pipe. I presume that's not a problem?
And you're clearly acclimatised to never getting to the end of a sentence. We'll get along splendidly. Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then. Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is two hundred and twenty-one B Baker Street.
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson. That's the trouble with dismembered country squires - they're notoriously difficult to schedule.
Thank you.
Caught the murderer; still looking for the legs. Think we'll call it a draw.
Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson. I'm hardly in the dog one.
Mrs Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room! Is it intentional?
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?
Well, why didn't you ask her?
Oh, for God's sake. Give her some lines. She's perfectly capable of starving us. Good afternoon. I'm Sherlock Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson. You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.
However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations. You have an impish sense of humour which currently you're deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish. You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals. You have come to this agency as a last resort in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.
Because I recognised it and you did not.
Enough! The stage is set, and the curtain rises. We are ready to begin.
Sometimes, to solve a case, one must first solve another.
An old one. Very old. I shall have to go deep.
Myself. Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.
The regulation tread is unmistakeable; lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.
I fear she's branched into literary criticism by means of satire. It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady. What brings you here in your off-duty hours?
Well, since your arrival you've addressed over forty percent of your remarks to my decanter. Watson, give the inspector what he so clearly wants.
Merry Christmas.
Thank God that's over. Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door but embarrasses you to relate?
You did, by every means short of actual speech.
Then correct me, Doctor.
My Boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast. Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard. Inspector, do sit down.
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger. It is nothing to be ashamed of.
From the beginning, then.
A moment. When was this?
The bride's face. How was it described?
Poetry or truth?
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?
After what?
Really, Lestrade. A woman blows her own brains out in public and you need help identifying the guilty party. I fear Scotland Yard has reached a new low.
I surmise.
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains.
'Til death us do part. Twice, in this case.
Superb! Suicide as street theatre; murder by corpse. Lestrade, you're spoiling us. Watson, your hat and coat.
To the morgue. There's not a moment to lose ... which one can so rarely say of a morgue.
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.
Who's on mortuary duty?
Always him.
Please tell me which idiot did this!
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.
Such as?
This is clearly a man's work. Where is he?
Hooper. 
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?
I never say that.
No, Watson. One place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased.
No.
Because it's never twins.
A what?
Since the moment of conception? How breathtakingly prescient of her! It is never twins, Watson.
More to the point, what's your problem?
Why were you so frightened? Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter, and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?
Gun in the mouth; a bullet through the brain; back of the head blown clean off. How could he survive?
I'm sorry?
Yes, yes, of course. Well, thank you all for a fascinating case. I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson?
Not yet. These are deep waters, Watson. Deep waters. And I shall have to go deeper still.
Hush, please. This is a matter of supreme importance.
The obliquity of the ecliptic. I have to understand it.
I don't know. I'm still trying to understand it.
Of course not. That would be an appalling waste of brain space. I specialise.
What's so important about five boring murders?
Solved it.
Of course I've solved it. It's perfectly simple. The Incident of the Mysterious Mrs Ricoletti, the Killer from Beyond the Grave, has been widely reported in the popular press. Now people are disguising their own dull little murders as the work of a ghost to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard. There you are: solved. Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out. She likes to feel involved.
Certainly. Go away. Watson! I'm ready. Get your hat and boots. We have an important appointment.
He did, didn't he? Who have I been talking to all this time?
It is, isn't it? Works surprisingly well, though. I actually thought he was improving.
The obliquity of the ecliptic.
It is. It's the inclination of the Earth's equator to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.
Why would I do that?
I am clever.
You see what?
Shut up.
   Good morning, Wilder. Is my brother in?
   The Stranger's Room?
   This gentleman is my guest.
   Yes. Needs work, Watson. Too much time spent on dancing lessons.
Handy, really, as your ever-expanding backside is permanently glued to it. Good morning, brother mine.
No need to worry on that score, Watson.
There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.
Oh, I wasn't being critical.
I'm still inclined to four.
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years, four months and eleven days.
I understand your disapproval, Watson, but if he's feeling competitive it is perfectly within his power to die early.
Three years flat if you eat that plum pudding.
No. I solved it.
Yes, it was Adams.
I know. I read it.
Yes, of course I understood it. It was perfectly simple.
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon ...
Doctor Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate.
Scots?!
Lady Carmichael's case - what is it?
I never really say that.
And you've solved it already, I assume?
On one condition. Have another plum pudding.
Two years, eleven months and four days.
That is easily got.
Not always so easy.
Then you are in luck.
Those are my specialisms. This is really very promising.
Please do tell us what has so distressed you.
No?
Did you keep the envelope?
Tell me: has Sir Eustace spent time in America?
Not even before your marriage?
Hmm. Pray continue with your fascinating narrative. 
And you saw nothing?
Did your husband describe ...
Hush, Watson.
You must forgive Watson. He has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious which borders on mania. May I ask: how is your husband this morning?
No, no! He must stay exactly where he is.
Oh no, somebody definitely wants to kill him, but that's good for us. You can't set a trap without bait.
No. But he could be if we play our cards right. Now, listen: you must go home immediately. Doctor Watson and I will follow on the next train. There's not a moment to lose. Sir Eustace is to die tonight.
... and we should ... probably avoid that.
Definitely avoid that.
I don't, and neither should you.
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency involved in this matter, and I was about to laugh in your face.
You amaze me, Watson.
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive. You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world ... save those we make for ourselves.
No.
I said no, she's not an hysteric. She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see anything of value whatsoever.
She married you. I assume she was capable of finding a reason. I'll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.
Yes. In detail, please.
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman. We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this? Thank you. Good afternoon.
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight, on the pretence of a violent headache. All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat? "This night you will die."
It's difficult to say quite what he'll do. Guilt is eating away at his soul.
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.
Not at all. Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death, originating in America. Sir Eustace knows this only too well, just as he knows why he is to be punished.
I presume. We all have a past, Watson.
Ghosts - they are the shadows that define our every sunny day. Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man. There's something more than murder he fears. He believes he is to be dragged to Hell by the risen corpse of the late Mrs Ricoletti.
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?
Exactly. Did you bring it?
Then come, Watson, come. The game is afoot!
Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake!
Yes. There goes Sir Eustace. And Lady Carmichael. The house sleeps.
Have patience, Watson.
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.
Who?
The fair sex is your department, Watson. I'll take your word for it.
And admirably high arches. I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.
You think so?
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.
Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.
What's the matter with you this evening?
You didn't 'glimpse' it. You waited 'til I had fallen asleep and looked at it.
You seriously thought I wouldn't notice?
Formidable opponent; a remarkable adventure.
Why are you talking like this?
Are you quite well, Watson?
From a Viennese alienist, no; from a retired Army surgeon, most certainly.
I concede it.
Please don't.
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson - which I rather fear you are - as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me. It is the grit in a sensitive instrument ...
... the crack in the lens.
Well, there you are, you see? I've said it all before.
Well, exactly.
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.
A what?!
Had what?
No.
Pass me your revolver. I have a sudden need to use it.
Dear Lord. I have never been so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost.
Oh, Watson. Nothing made me. I made me. Redbeard?
Why don't we have a chat? Mrs Ricoletti, I believe. Pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?
No, it can't.
As per instructions.
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with. Stay in here, Watson.
All the doors and windows to the house are locked. This is their only way out. I need you here.
Stay here!
Watson!
Don't tell me you abandoned your post.
Empty, thanks to you! Our bird is flown.
THERE ARE NO GHOSTS!
Dead.
No, you're quite right.
Watson is equally culpable. Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case. I gave an undertaking to protect that man; now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.
In the confident expectation I would not have to.
Watson.
You saw nothing. You saw what you were supposed to see.
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible - which in this case is the ghost - and observe what remains - which in this case is a solution so blindingly obvious, even Lestrade could work it out.
Forget spectres from the otherworld. There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity. They might as well have left a note.
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.
Precisely. There isn't one. The only broken window in this establishment is the one that Watson and I entered through, yet prior to that we distinctly heard the sound of What did you just say?
About a note. What did you just say?
No they didn't.
There's no message.
There was no message when I found the body.
Do I what? How did you get that? I left it at the crime scene.
Moriarty is dead.
His body was never recovered.
'Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?'  Have you put on weight?
No.
In England?
Of what?
No. I haven't finished yet.
He's trying to distract me, to derail me.
I have to finish this.
I'll be waiting.
And possibly my answer has crossed yours.
You'll forgive me for taking precautions.
I'm sure you've acquainted yourself with them before now.
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments during my absence.
Yes.
Won't you sit down?
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit ...
Sit down.
You chose to come here.
The truth.
But you couldn't have killed him.
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to stop me ... to distract me, derail me.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.
I'm sorry?
How can you be alive?
You blew your own brains out. How could you survive?
I saw you die. Why aren't you dead?
No, no, no, not now, not now. No, no, no, not now, not now.
I have to go back!
I was ... I was nearly there! I nearly had it!
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?
It was a case, a famous one from a hundred years ago, lodged in my hard drive. She seemed to be dead but then she came back.
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called. What progress have you made? What have you been doing?
I've been in my Mind Palace, of course ...
... running an experiment: how would I have solved the crime if I'd been there in 1895?
I had all the details perfect. I was there, all of it, everything! I was immersed.
Helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes. I'm so much cleverer.
Yes, and I need to get back there.
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.
You've put on weight. That waistcoat's clearly newer than the jacket ...
Of what?
I'm not an addict. I'm a user. I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.
Controlled usage is not usually fatal, and abstinence is not immortality.
Could you all just shut up for five minutes? I have to go back. I was nearly there before you stepped on and starting yapping away.
No. It only encourages you.
Oh, that's a relief. I was really worried. No, hold on. I really wasn't.
It was nothing to do with you.
Realised what?
Oh, for God's sake.
What did you say?
No, you did. You said ...
Which is it today - morphine or cocaine?
Holmes?
Moriarty was here.
I was on a jet.
You were there, and Mycroft.
Cocaine. A seven percent solution. Would you care to try it?
I should be inclined to stop you.
You're not a soldier. You are a doctor.
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgement.
No, I just said that in one of your stories. 
Why?
What people? Why? Because of your idiot stories?
It's Mary.
It's entirely possible she's in danger.
There's not a moment to lose.
Come on!
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson. Never that.
I'm fine!
Why?
Oh, good old Watson! How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?
A desanctified church. She thinks she's found the solution, and for no better reason than that, she's put herself in the path of considerable danger. What an excellent choice of wife.
Bravo, Mary. 'The clever one'?
Well, you're the one who moved out.
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you that your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?
Only now, I'm afraid.
Time I sped up. Enough chatter. Let's concentrate.
Why don't we go and find out? Sorry. I could never resist a gong. Or a touch of the dramatic.
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard. Excellent. Superlative theatre. I applaud the spectacle. Emelia Ricoletti shot herself, then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband. So, how was it done? Let's take the events in order. Mrs Ricoletti gets everyone's attention in very efficient fashion.
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth while actually firing the other into the ground. An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood ... and thus her apparent suicide is witnessed by the frightened crowd below. A substitute corpse bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti takes her place and is later transported to the morgue. A grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard. Meanwhile the real Mrs Ricoletti slips away. Now comes the really clever part. Mrs Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver - someone who knew her - to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den. The perfect stage for a perfect drama.
A perfect positive identification.
The late Mrs Ricoletti has returned from the grave ... and with a little skilled make-up and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost. There was only one thing left to do.
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs Ricoletti for the corpse in the morgue. This time, should anyone attempt to identify her ... it would be positively, absolutely her.
Every great cause has martyrs; every war has suicide missions - and make no mistake, this is war. One half of the human race at war with the other. The invisible army hovering at our elbow, attending to our homes, raising our children, ignored, patronised, disregarded, not allowed so much as a vote. ... but an army nonetheless, ready to rise up in the best of causes, to put right an injustice as old as humanity itself. So, you see, Watson, Mycroft was right. This is a war we must lose.
Who was?
So she decided to make her death count. She was already familiar with the secret societies of America and was able to draw on their methods of fear and intimidation to publicly - very publicly - confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.
Hooper!
Yes, Watson, we did. But the sound of breaking glass? Not a window. Just an old theatrical trick.
No, it can't.
It's called Pepper's Ghost. A simple reflection, in glass, of a living breathing person. Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it. Look around you. This room is full of Brides. Once she had risen, anyone could be her. The avenging ghost - a legend to strike terror into the heart of any man with malicious intent; a spectre to stalk those unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue. A league of furies awakened. The women I ... we have lied to, betrayed ... the women we have ignored ... and disparaged. Once the idea exists, it cannot be killed. This is the work of a single-minded person, someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty. A dark secret, kept from all but her closest friends ... including Emelia Ricoletti ... the woman her husband wronged all those years before. If one disregards the ghost, there is only one suspect. Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael? One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however. Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit? Hmm?
No. No, not you. It can't be you.
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti. I need to know where she was buried.
Yes.
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.
Yes.
My investigation was the fantasy. The crime happened exactly as I explained.
I need to try!
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here, but what happened to the other one, the corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?
But where?
But that ... that's exactly what they must have done. The conspirators had someone on the inside. They found a body, just like Molly Hooper found a body for me when I ... Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?
It's why we came here! I need to know.
This is important to me!
John ...
Getting to that! It's next on the list! Just let me do this.
John, please ...
So what if he's right? He's always right. It's boring. Will you help me?
Urgh!
They must have buried it underneath. They must have buried it underneath the coffin.
Oh, I see. Still not awake, am I?
The setting's a shade melodramatic, don't you think?
What are you?
Moriarty's dead.
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I concede it may be even be the equal of my own.
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat on the edge of a precipice ... you're going in the water ... short-arse.
Thank you, John.
You'd be surprised. 
Of course. Of course you do, John. 
Smarter than he looks.
Pretty damned smart.
Offensive.
Not at all. 
Quite so.
Ohhh, I should think like this.
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Miss me?
Yes, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?
No time. I have to go to Baker Street now. Moriarty's back.
No need for that now. Got the real thing. I have work to do.
What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something, like a proper big brother?
I never said he was alive. I said he was back.
Of course he's dead. He blew his own brains out. No-one survives that. I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it. Moriarty is dead, no question. But more importantly ... I know exactly what he's going to do next.
It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like, and how you and I might fit inside it. From a drop of water, a logician should be able to infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.
Have you written up your account of the case?
Hmm. Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course?
"The Adventure of ... the Invisible Army."  "The League of Furies"?  "The Monstrous Regiment."
A trifle lurid.
You're the expert.
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful ... but perhaps such things could come to pass. In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.
I beg to differ. But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
No.
Of course I'm not tweeting. Why would I be tweeting?
What? No. Get off. What are you doing? Get off. What ...?
Don't read them out.
God, you're such a spoilsport.
I am taking it seriously. What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously?
Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death - and now I'm back, in a nice warm office with my big brother and ... Are those ginger nuts?
Love ginger nuts.
I am, utterly. No need for stimulants now, remember? I have work to do.
Natural high, I assure you. Totally natural. I'm just ... ♪ glad to be aliiiiiive! ♪  What shall we do next? What's your name?
What would you do, Vivian?
Well, it's a lovely day. Go for a stroll? Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly? 
Ice lolly it is! What's your favourite?
Go on.
Yes?
Do your research. I'm not a hero. I'm a high functioning sociopath. ... sociopath. ... sociopath. I see. Who is supposed to have shot him, then?
That's not what happened at all. 
Okay, cheers.
I told you. Moriarty's dead.
Yes.
No, no. He would never be that disappointing. He's planned something; something long-term; something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive. Posthumous revenge. No - better than that. Posthumous game.
Wait.
Of course wait. I'm the target. Targets wait. Look - whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up, I'll know when it begins. I always know when the game is on. D'you know why?
Because I love it.
There was once a merchant in the famous market at Baghdad. One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise ... and he knew that the stranger was Death. Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles to the city of Samarra, for there he was sure Death could not find him. But when at last he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death. "Very well," said the merchant. "I give in. I am yours. But tell me: why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?" "Because," said Death, "I had an appointment with you tonight - in Samarra."
If this gets any better, I'm gonna get two knives.
Ooh, I have a plan. I'm going to monitor the underworld - every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
Awesome, isn't it?!
Superficial.
Come back! It's the wrong thumb!
It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson. Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
Yes. You may have nothing but a limbless torso but there'll still be traces of ink left in the lymph nodes under the armpits. If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs'll be there.
I never guess.
'Course he's the killer.
Hm, naturally.
That's it! The place was spinning.
The heart medication you are taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck are your own.
I know.
Well, you could try.
Mary?
We're in a lot of trouble.
That's it, Mary. Re... 
...lax. 
Oh my God.
Well, you know what I think.
You too what?
God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
I'll get back to you.
Rosamund? 
No. I delete his texts. I delete any text that begins, 'Hi.'
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe. To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery whereas, to me, it is an open book. Hard logic versus romantic whimsy. That is your choice. You fail to connect actions to their consequences. Now, for the last time ... if you want to keep the rattle ... do not throw the rattle, hm?
Who cares about that? Tell me about the seats.
Yes. The car seats. Made of vinyl ... two different types of vinyl present.  Was it his own car?
Well, that's suggestive.
Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
Yes?
What?
Oh, this is a good one. Is it my birthday? You want help?
One condition.
Take all the credit. It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Okay.
Anything you say, Giles. Just kidding. What is it?
What?
Oh.
John, you amaze me. You know what happened?
Mm. Well, then ... let's help you solve your little problem, Greg.
I'm sorry, what?
Are you two having a little joke?
This is a joke, isn't it?
Is it about me?
No, don't get it.
You know me.
How do you know about that?
Solved it, then?
Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.
Keep trying.
Don't give it a title.
I hate the titles.
No, never do that. People are stupid.
All people are stupid. ... Most people.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough. I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
Son.
Well, I believe that I ... can.
Sorry. You were saying?
No, shouldn't think so.  So sorry. Will you excuse me a moment? I just ...
Not sure. I just ... 'By the pricking of my thumbs.'
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.  What is this?
Right, yes.  Who?
Who-who is this? 
Right.  Prime Minister?
Right.  Female?
It's the gap. Look at the gap. It's wrong. Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed ...  This whole thing's verging on OCD.  My respects. This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in. This picture's straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.  Something's missing from here, but only recently. 
... plaster bust.
Rug!
Well, how could it get broken? The only place for it to fall is the floor, and there is a big thick rug.
The porch where we came in?
I'm no expert but, er, possibly her face?  Why didn't he smash all the others? Perfect opportunity, and look at that one. She's smiling in that one.
I know what happened to your son.
It's quite simple. Superficial, to be blunt. But first, tell me: the night of the break-in. This room was in darkness?
And the porch where it was smashed: I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it's permanently lit.
I lack the arrogance to ignore details. I'm not the police.
Exactly.
Dunno. Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
It was your fiftieth birthday, Mr Welsborough; of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year. After all, he was in Tibet.
No.
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video. Easily arranged.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
Obviously.
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car. One the actual passenger seat; the other a good copy. Well, good enough.  Effectively a costume.
No, I'm not. What he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
That's when it happened.  I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure. You said he'd felt unwell?
He died there and then. No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained in the driver's seat hidden until ...  When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there quite dead for a week.
Really, I'm so sorry, Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.  This is where it was smashed.
What?
Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it?
Can't stand it. Never can. There's a loose thread in the world.
What kind of a life would that be? Besides, I have the strangest feeling.
That's mine. You two take a ... bus.
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.  The Mall, please.
Thatcher? 
You thought that?!
That's her. John and Mary's baby.
Is that really the best you can do?
Babies?
Moriarty. Did he have any connection with Thatcher? Any interest in her?
I don't know. You tell me.
It's a pearl. Get another one.  There's something important about this.  I'm sure. Maybe it's Moriarty. Maybe it's not. But something's coming.
The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other. What we call premonition is just movement of the web. If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable, as inevitable as mathematics.
I'm sorry?
I'm not sure I like it now.
Goodnight, Mycroft. 
Keep me informed.
Absolutely no idea.
Will you two please keep it down?
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.  Oh, don't bother being astonished. Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left.  Hard manual work does that.
And you're trying to give up smoking, unsuccessfully, and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes. Now, if you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things, but you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe because that means you're not serious about quitting, so instead you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last. Anything to add, John?  John?
What is that?
Don't be so hard on yourself.  You know I value your little contributions.
Has it? Where were you?
What?
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name 'Akako.'  It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would have had the word obliterated, but the first attempt wasn't successful and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
You thought she was having an affair. I'm afraid it's far worse than that. Your wife is a spy. 
That's right. Her real name is Greta Bengtsdotter.  Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world. She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife for one reason only: to get near the American embassy which is across the road from your flat. Tomorrow the US president will be at the embassy as part of an official state visit. As the president greets members of staff, Greta Bengtsdotter, disguised as a twenty-two stone cleaner, will inject the president in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit. This drug will then render the president entirely susceptible to the will of their new master, none other than James Moriarty. 
Moriarty will then use the president as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first strike policy against Russia. This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating ... World War Three.
No, of course not.  His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
Get out.
Having fun.
While I can.
Borgia Pearl, boring, go.
Go!  Oh, this had better be good.
I am pleased.
This is my game face.  And the game is on. 
No, no good. There were other images of Margaret ... Margaret?
... Thatcher present at the first break-in. Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one?  Ooh.
Blood. Quite a bit of it, too.  Was there any injury at the crime scene?
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.  Come on.
Lambeth.
To see Toby.
You'll see.
No. He's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for. 
The right sleeve of your jacket ... plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne ... and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch. Have a good time.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
She's not the one.
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Possibly.
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best. He got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago. He hacked into the Pentagon's security system, and I managed to get him off the charge. Therefore he owes me a favour.
What?
Toby's not the hacker.
All right, Craig?
Craig's got a dog!
Good boy! 
Hey.
She's better at this than you.
So I texted her.
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill set. Of course she's better.
Nothing personal.
John or the dog?
Well ...
Mm.
Barnicot's house, then. Anyone up for a trudge?  Keep up. He's fast.
He's thinking.
Slow but sure, John; not dissimilar to yourself.
Well, I like you.
Fascinating.
Well? What do you make of it?
Yes, but it wasn't a burglar. They came specifically for that Thatcher bust. Why?  Clever.
Or blood in a butchers'.  Never mind, Toby. Better luck next time, hm?  This is it, though. This is the one.  I can feel it.
It has to be him. It's too bizarre; it's too baroque.  It's designed to beguile me, tease me, lure me in. At last - a noose for me to put my neck into.
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Mm. 
Yes, fascinating, irrelevant. Where exactly did they come from?
Where exactly?
Lestrade, another one?
Harker or Sandeford?
Hm, that perks things up a bit.
The same thing inside the house? The bust?
Interesting. That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago - limited edition of six.
No, they're not destroying them. That's not what's happening.
Well, it is what's happening, but it's not the point. I've been slow; far too slow.
Slow but lucky; very lucky. And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold. Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next. Congratulations, by the way.
Well, you're about to solve a big one.
Yeah. 'Til then, basically. 
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?  You were on the run; nowhere to hide your precious cargo.  You find yourself in a workshop. Plaster busts of The Iron Lady drying. It's clever, very clever. But now you've met me, and you're not so clever, are you?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
You're out of time. Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
I know it's him. It must be him.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment?  Let me present Interpol's number one case. Too tough for them; too boring for me.  The Black Pearl of the Borgias.  It's not possible. How could she ...?
I don't understand.  She ... she destroyed it.
Mary. This is about Mary.
She's my friend, and she's under my protection. Who are you?
Not a policeman.
Well?
I very much doubt it.
Because I think he used to work with Mary. 
I am an idiot. I know nothing.
I was so convinced it was Moriarty, I couldn't see what was right under my nose.  I expected a pearl.
Yes, it's an AGRA memory stick like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else. Who?
I glanced at it, but I'd prefer to hear it from you.
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
Not just agents.
Who employed you?
Who from?
"Ammo"?
No.
I met someone tonight: the same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Yeah, very much so. 
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?
So Ajay survived as well, and now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide with all of AGRA's old aliases on it. But why?
Tbilisi was six years ago. Where's he been?  Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
Families fall out. The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down. You're the only other survivor. It must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
I heard it from his own mouth. "Tell her she's a dead woman walking."
He said you betrayed him.
Well, it's what he believes.
Yes, well he's a very tangible ghost.
No. Mary, you do. I made a vow, remember?  To look after the three of you.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him. I promise you.
What is it?
What are you ...?  Mary.
Oh, no.
No.
What are you, Wikipedia?
AGRA is an acronym.
Team of agents, the best. But you know all that.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Is it?  He's already killed looking for that memory stick. AGRA always worked for the highest bidder. I thought that might include you.
Well, I mean the British government or whatever government you're currently propping up.
Your initiative?
There was something else; a detail, a code word.
It's all I've got.
Could you do some digging, as a favour?
Then I'm calling them all in.
Of course.
No. It's me.
Told you: I made a promise, a vow.
Not on my watch.
Mr Baker. Well, that completes the set.
Well, who else am I missing?
Maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.  Oh, hi, Mary.
Happy families.  Nice trip?
Please, Mary. There is a child present.
Karim let me in.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?
Thank you.
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
Mary, no human action is ever truly random. An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables considerably.  I myself know of at least fifty-eight techniques to refine this seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.  But they're really difficult, so instead I just ... stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
I know, but your face!
You believed that.
Yes. I started to run out about then.
I will keep you safe.  But it has to be in London. It's my city; I know the turf.  Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.  Get down!
How did you find us?
What did you hear, Ajay? When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear?
And they said it was her?
They said her name?
The English woman. That's all he heard. Naturally he assumed it was Mary.
No, it's not over. Ajay said that they'd been betrayed. The hostage takers knew AGRA were coming. There was only a voice on the phone, remember, and a code word.
How's your Latin, brother dear?
Amo, amas, amat.
Not 'ammo' as in 'ammunition' but 'amo,' meaning ...?
Your office said I'd find you here.
Predatory.
Nice location for the final act. Couldn't have chosen it better myself. But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I really am a very busy man. Would you mind cutting to the chase?
With good reason.
I really have never liked this story.
Hello, Mary.
John?
Let me introduce Amo.
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Oh, let me guess. Selling secrets?
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Mary, no!
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
... for a secretary.
Can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
No? Same old drudge, day in, day out, never getting out there where all the excitement was. Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.  They've taken up the pavement outside the Post Office there. The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.  Yes, your little flat.
Well, on your salary it would have to be modest and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you, and what are you, widowed or divorced?  Wedding ring's at least thirty years old and you've moved it to another finger. That means you're sentimentally attached to it but you're not still married. I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.  A divorcee's more likely to look for a new partner; a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
Pets do that, or so I'm told, and there's clearly no-one new in your life, otherwise you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium. That probably accounts for the drink problem, too: the slight tremor in your hand ... the red wine stain ghosting your top lip. So yes. I say jealousy was your motive after all - to prove how good you are ... to make up for the inadequacies of your little life.
Vivian Norbury, who outsmarted them all. All except Sherlock Holmes.  There's no way out.
It's what I do.
Everything's fine. It's gonna be okay.  Get an ambulance.  It's all right, it's all right.
Yes?
Yes. Yes, y-you did.
It's-it's all right.
Okay.
That's not really my style.  I need to know what to do.
About John.
I'm afraid it won't.
Just going to, um ... look through these things. There might be a case.
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Mrs Hudson?
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit ... full of myself, cocky or ... over-confident ... 
... would you just say the word 'Norbury' to me, would you?
Just that.  I'd be very grateful.  What's this?
Must be.
I knew it wouldn't end like this. I knew Moriarty made plans.
I just ... wondered how things were going and ... and if there was anything I could do.
Right.
Yes?
When does the path we walk on lock around our feet? When does the road become a river with only one destination? Death waits for us all in Samarra. But can Samarra be avoided?
What word?
What name?
Well, you've changed. You no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing. Letting yourself go?
No. Do you own an American car?
No, not American; left-hand drive, that's what I mean.
Not sure, actually. Probably just noticed something.
Oh, of course you don't own a car. You don't need one, do you, living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.
It's all here, isn't it? Look. Cost-cutting's clearly a priority for you. Look at the size of your kitchen: teeny-tiny. Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook.
Hang on a minute ... I was looking out of the window. Why was I doing that?
Me either. Must have had a reason. It'll come back to me. Presumably you downsized when you ... when you left your job ... and maybe when you ended your relationship.
'Course I can. There wasn't anything physical going on, was there? Quite some time, in fact. There, see? It's obvious.
Think I just did, didn't I? I'm sure that was me. 
Dunno. Just sort of ... happens, really. It's ... like a reflex. I can't stop it. Coat.
Yeah, that's what I just noticed. I wonder why?
Piss off.
Of what?
Oh, it's way too weird for me. Go to the police; they're really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction. Night-night.
Yes, but I'm very busy at the moment. I have to drink a cup of tea.
It's a cup of tea.
Really? That's bad luck, isn't it? Goodnight. Go away.
Stop talking. It makes me aware of your existence.
Handbag.
Handbag! Stop. Wait! Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it, do you hear me? Off it.  Off it.
Your skirt.
Look at the hem of it! That's what I noticed. I'm ... still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast. Those markings. Do you see them? You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door but they're on the left-hand side, so you weren't driving; you were in the passenger seat.
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside. That's what I checked when I went to the window. And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you. You didn't even bring a coat - in this rain? Now, well, that might mean nothing, except for the angle of the scars on your left forearm; you know, under that sleeve that you keep pulling down.
No, I didn't, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis. Don't really need to check that the angle's consistent with self-harm, do I?
Then you can keep your scars. I want to see your handbag.
It's too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home ... and a gun. Chips.
You're suicidal. You're allowed chips, trust me. It's about the only perk.
I think I remember the way. It's through there, isn't it?
Yeah, well, I've got a friend with me, so ...
'Bye!
Come on.
You see the fold in the middle? For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book. Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease. So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed. Conclusion: relationship. Not any more, though. There's a pinprick at the top of the paper. For the past few months it's been on open display on a wall. Conclusion: relationship is over. The paper's been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells ... so it must have been on display in the kitchen. Lots of different spices. You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash, yet you're still cooking to impress. You're keen, then. The kitchen is the most public room in any house, but since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don't have any. You've isolated yourself.
I know.
Hm. Let's go for a walk.
Look at the fading pattern on the paper. It's not much but it's enough to know your kitchen window faces east. Now, kitchen noticeboards ... By instinct we place them at eye level where there's natural light. Now look: the sun's only struck the bottom two thirds ... but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window. But because the top section is unaffected ... we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle. If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky ... then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom. But no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor. Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room? The room's small.
Literally.
I'm sorry?
It's all about the blood. This one comes from the very first night. You can see the pen marks over it. I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory, so you tried it again later. I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.
Oh, well, because he would have done something about it.
Wouldn't he? Isn't that what you people do?
What is?
Superbly?
I'm not sweet; I'm just high. This way.
I know. It's a plan.
Possibly. It's a long word.
"Bollocks."
D'you know why I'm going to take your case? Because of the one impossible thing you've said.
You said your life turned on one word.
That's the impossible thing. Just that, right there.
Names aren't one word. They're always at least two. Sherlock Holmes; Faith Smith; Santa Claus; Winston Churchill; Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, just 'Napoleon' would do.
Well, I think we can rule both of them out as targets.
And you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word, so that happened, I don't doubt it, but how can that word be a name - a name you instantly recognised that tore your world apart?
No idea. Yet. But I don't work for free.
Not cash, no. "Taking your own life." Interesting expression. Taking it from who? Oh, once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it. Your own death is something that happens to everybody else. Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it.
What ... what am I?
Than who?
Sorry, I ... Faith? Faith?
You said your life turned on one word. A name can't be one word.
What ... what am I?
Than who?
Who?
Of course! He doesn't want to kill one person; he wants to kill anyone. He's a serial killer!
He could be.
Why not? Why shouldn't he be?
What are you doing here?
You should be at Baker Street.
They're always poor ... and lonely, and strange. But those are only the ones we catch.
Serial killers. What if you were rich and ... powerful and necessary.
What if ... you had the compulsion to kill, and money? What then?
Wait!
Where is it?!
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends ... once more!  Or close the wall up with our English dead! ... set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide. Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height! On, on, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof! And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture which I doubt not, for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes! I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start! The game's afoot."  Oh, hello. Can I have a cup of tea?
What pictures?
Oh, these pictures! Oh, you can see them too. That's good.
Cup of tea! Oh, for goodness' sakes. What's the matter with you? Are you having an earthquake?!
The woman's out of control. I asked for a cup of tea!
They dropped me. Twice.
Who's this one? Is this a new person? I'm against new people.
Awesome! D'you do block bookings?
Get me a fresh glass of water, please. This one's filthy.
Really? I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised? Can't everyone do that?
Except the boot. The boot was mean.
Because Mrs Hudson's right. I'm burning up. I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling and I'm never climbing out. I need you to know, John - I need you to see that up here ... I've still got it, so when I tell you that this ... is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered; when I tell you that this-this monster must be ended, please remember where you're standing, because ... you're standing exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago. I'm a mess; I'm in hell; but I am not wrong, not about him.
That creature, that rotting thing, is a living breathing coagulation of human evil, and if the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it, then my life will not have been wasted. Look at me. Can't do it, not now. Not alone.
Why would I be faking?
I have been many things, John, but when have I ever been a malingerer?
... Apart from that?
Well, you're a doctor. Examine me. 
Oh, John, calm down. When have you ever managed two opinions? You'd fall over.
Who's that, then? I'm sure I would have noticed.
You're really not gonna like this.
If you'd like to know how I predict the future ...
Okay. Fully equipped ambulance; Molly can examine me on the way. It'll save time. Ready to go, Molly?
Just tell me when to cough. Hope you remembered my coat.
Basically fine.
Yeah but, to be fair, you work with murder victims. They tend to be quite young.
Little bit funny.
Exactly, weeks. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'm worried about you, Molly. You seem very stressed.
Yeah, well, I'm ahead, then. Stress can ruin every day of your life. Dying can only ruin one.
When have I ever been that?
Oh, clever boy. I've missed you fumbling 'round the place.
What?
'Course it's not a trick. It's a plan.
Thirty feet and closing: the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history. Help me bring him down.
I'm not telling you.
Because you won't like it.
I know.
Oh, yes.
Brilliant, isn't it?
Safest place to hide. Plain sight.
Oh, okay.
I needed a hug.
It's funny 'cause it's true!
Oh, you can have this back now.
Thanks for the hug. Oh, I sent and deleted a text. You might get a reply but I doubt it.
Please!
Oh no. No, not endless.
I can wait until the hospital.
Say what you like about addiction; the day is full of highlights.
Psychedelic!
Great. I ...
It is. He writes the blog.
You're welcome!
Hello!
No.
Yes! Absolutely, yes.  The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals - step by step - the solution. That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair. Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington the Poisoner.
There were five main suspects ...
... but it's more about how he did it.
Okay. Drearcliff House. Remember that one, John? One murder, ten suspects. 
All of them guilty.
Uh, wh-wh-wh-what did you call that one, John? Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.
Or-or was it The Case of the Killer Orang-Utan?
So, any more questions?
No?
Good, then I'll ... 
Same way you catch any other killer.
Some of them advertise.
Serial killing is an expression of power, ego, a signature in human destruction. Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight. Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled. They tend to be social outcasts, educationally sub-normal.
Where are we going now?
No, let's go in here. So you've had another one of your little meetings.
It's a memory inhibitor.
Anyone ever 'opt' to remember?
Indeed. You have - I estimate - twenty minutes left.
I sent a text from your phone, remember? It was read almost immediately. Factoring in a degree of shock, an emotional decision and a journey time based on the associated address, I'd say that your life as you know it has twenty minutes left to run. Well, no, seventeen and a half, to be precise but I rounded up for dramatic effect, so please do show us your favourite room. It'll give you a chance to say ... goodbye.
Other than yourself?
Not as far as I know.
So, your favourite room: the mortuary.
Tough crowd.
Serial killer, active during the Chicago Fair.
I apologise. I-I-I've miscalculated. I forgot to factor in the traffic! Nineteen and a half minutes. Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two. The third, of course, will be the end of a walking cane. Your daughter Faith's walking cane.
You invited her. You sent her a text - or-or-or technically I sent her a text but she's not to know. Ah, let's see if I can recall. "Faith... I can stand it no longer, I've confessed... to my crimes. Please forgive me!" 
Oh, but I do. I spent a whole evening with her. We had chips. I think she liked me.
I know you care about her deeply. I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings. You care what she thinks. You maintain an impressive façade. I think it's about to break.
She came to Baker Street.
She came to see me because she was scared of her daddy.
Well, let's see, shall we? Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in! This is your father's favourite room. Come and meet his best friends.
Who the hell are you?
You're not her. You're not the woman who came to Baker Street.
Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.
So who came to my flat?
You ... look ... different.
Who came to my flat?
Faith?
God. 
Watch him. He's got a knife.
You've got a scalpel! You picked it up from that table.  I saw you take it.
Look behind his back!
I saw you take it! I saw you!
Stop laughing at me.
STOP LAUGHING AT ME!
STOP LAUGHING AT ME!
No, it's-it's okay. Let him do what he wants. He's entitled. I killed his wife.
How did you get in?
Secret door.
H. H. Holmes.
You know why I'm here.
I want you to kill me.
If you increase the dosage four or five times ... toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour.
Yes.
I feel scared.
I'm ... scared of dying.
I have ... reasons.
No.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't ... don't want to die.
I wanted to hear your confession; needed to know I was right.
The mortuary; your favourite room. You talk to the dead. You make your confession to them.
Why do you do it?
Suffocating me, overdosing me. 
Saline.
Yeah, saline.
Well obviously I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags. She's a big fan, you know? Loves my blog.
No-no, of course I'm not okay. Malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly I've been off my tits for weeks. What kind of a doctor are you? I got my confession, though, didn't I?
You can listen to it later.
Must be something comforting about the number three. People always give up after three.
Yeah.
Heard you the first time.
Screw the top.
Three.
No. I'm just a cock.
I had, of course, several other backup plans. Trouble is, I couldn't remember what they were. And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.
Still a bit troubled by the daughter. Did seem very real, and she gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere.
Interesting, isn't it? I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.
Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind. I'm intrigued. 
I thought we were just hanging out.
Oh, I do think I can last twenty minutes without supervision.
Yes, of course, Rosie.
Yes. Yes! Sorry, I-I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
I should, uh, come and see her soon.
Oh, by the way, the recordings will probably be inadmissible.
Well, technically, it's entrapment so it might get thrown out as evidence. Not that that matters; apparently he can't stop confessing. 
Yeah. Are you okay?
In saving my life, she conferred a value on it. It is a currency I do not know how to spend.
Looking forward to it.
Mm? What was what?
What noise?
John?
Oh, okay. That's good.
Okay. Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert to become randomly attached to a ...
Thank you, John. That's ... very kind of you. 
Well, now you do. 
Talk about what?
How does what work?
Oh, for God's sakes. I don't text her back.
What?
Why?
I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.
As I think I have explained to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people ...
That doesn't even mean anything.
Mary? How so?
Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say ...
It's okay.
No. But it is what it is.
So Molly's going to meet us at this 'cake place.'
Oh, well. Suppose a sugar high's some sort of substitute.
Right then. You know ... it's not my place to say but ... it was just texting. People text. Even I text. Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea; try not to, but, you know, sometimes. It's not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling, from time to time, that we might all just be human.
No. Even you.
Cake. Oh, um ...
I'm Sherlock Holmes. I wear the damn hat. Isn't that right, Mary?
Get out!
Yes, boring. Go away!
Why not, given your immediate alternative?
She was real.
Experiment complete. Conclusion: I have a sister.
Conclusion two: my sister - Eurus, apparently - has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother. Hey, bro!
Conclusion three: you are terrified of her!
It's more than possible. She was John's therapist.
Only with a tranquilliser.
Well, we'll see about a refund. Right, you two. Wiggins has got your money by the gate. Don't spend it all in one crack den. Oh, I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie.
Well, we're not staying here. Eurus is coming and, uh, someone's disabled all your security. Sleep well!
Then get out.
You're going to tell the truth, Mycroft, pure and simple.
I don't know and I don't care. So there were three of us. I know that now. You, me, and ... Eurus. A sister I can't remember. Interesting name, Eurus. It's Greek, isn't it?
"The East Wind is coming, Sherlock." You used that to scare me.
You turned my sister into a ghost story.
Why can't I remember her?
John stays.
That's why he stays.
As you never cease to announce.
Then why don't I remember her?
What do you mean? Examples.
What happened?
Help succour me now ...
... the East winds blow.
Sixteen by six ...
Fragments.
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Redbeard! Redbeard!
He was my dog.
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Redbeard!
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Redbeard!
What happened to Redbeard?
Where?
This is a lie.
And no doubt to prevent their further interference.
Where is she, Mycroft? Where's our sister?
It's a drone.
What's that silver thing on top of it, Mycroft?
How powerful?
It's Sunday morning, so it's closed.
Going by her usual routine, I estimate she has another two minutes left.
When the vacuum stops, we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat. She's fast when she's cleaning. Then we move. What's the trigger response time? Once we're mobile, how long before detonation?
John and I will take the windows; you take the stairs. Help get Mrs Hudson out too.
You're closer.
Speed differential won't be as critical as the distance.
I estimate we have a minute left. Is a phone call possible?
John has a daughter. He may wish to say goodbye.
Yeah. You were great.
Yes, I really do.
Good luck, boys. Three, two, one, go!
My name's Sherlock Holmes.
The pirate.
North side of the island, sir.
Right, sir.
Sir.
Just arriving at the Secure Unit. Explain.
Why?
Eyes on Eurus Holmes. Governor's orders.
You what?
Why the headphones?
Beautiful.
Aye. Still beautiful, though.
I'm sorry?
I'm not one of the ... I-I don't work here.
I'm not one of your doctors.
No.
No, we've spoken since then. You came round to my flat a few weeks back; you pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith. We had chips.
How did you manage to get out of this place? How did you do that?
I am looking at you.
See what?
Beautiful.
I meant your playing.
Often they're the same thing.
I need to know how you escaped.
It's a Stradivarius.
Who from?
Why?
How did you know?
Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
What do you mean, "rewritten"?
I need to know how you got out of here.
Me?
Why do you ask?
How?
I take it he didn't consent.
She?
So clearly you remember me.
Not now.
In a minute.
Yes.
Why?
Tell me what you remember.
Why was I your favourite?
Why?
Why was I screaming? Redbeard.  I remember Redbeard.
Tell me what I don't know.
Redbeard was my dog. I know what happened to Redbeard.
It's more common than you'd think.
Signs. You suspended the signs.
Transparent.
How are you?
True dat, but you have your uses.
Yes.
Family's always difficult.
Mm, case in point.
Apparently.
As he is told. Eurus is in control.
It's okay. He's dead.
Do shut up, dear.
Be quiet.
Oh, hello. Um, try-try to stay calm. Just te-tell me what your name is.
Of course not. Very good. But, um, I'll tell you mine. My name is ... Hello?
The girl - where is she? Can I talk to her again?
Please don't do that.
How?
Doesn't appear we have a choice.
Okay, fine. John.
I know. It's all right.
It's all right.
No!
Are you all right?
All right, there you go. You got what you wanted ... and he's dead.
What if I don't want a gun?
For whom?
How so?
There's only one bullet left.
Treats?
In exchange for ...?
I'm beginning to think you're not.
Someone's been redecorating.
She's literally taken over the asylum. We have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.
It's for our benefit.
Yes, hello? Hello. We're still here. Can you hear us?
Everything's gonna be all right. I just need you to tell me where you are. Outside, is it day or night?
What kind of a plane are you on?
Where did you take off from?
No, I understand; but where did you come from? Where did the plane take off?
And where are you going?
No, I mean what airport are you ...
This. This is all we get.
What do you make of it?
Yes, I should think you are.
Fine. John? John?
Glasses, glasses. Nathan wears glasses. Evans was shot from three hundred metres. Kickback from a gun with this calibre ... would be massive. No cuts, no scarring. Not Nathan, then. Who's next?
Justice?
You'll drop them into the sea.
Oh. That's nice. Try to tell me more about the plane. 
So it's got to be one of the other two. Now, Howard. Howard's a lifelong drunk. Pallor of his skin, terminal gin blossoms on his red nose ... and - terror notwithstanding - a bad case of the DTs. There's no way he could have taken that shot from three hundred metres away. So that leaves us with Alex. Indentations on the temples suggest he habitually wears glasses. Frown lines suggest a lifetime of peering.
Laser surgery?
Excellent. Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he's dumped the specs. Even has a spray tan. But he's clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual. That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there's hair growing in his ears. So it's a superficial job, then. But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger. He killed Evans.
The plane, remember?
Alex.
I condemn Alex Garrideb.
John. Don't let her distract you.
Soldiers today.
It's okay, don't worry. I don't have very long with you, so I just need you to tell me what you can see outside the plane.
Are there ships on it?
Is it a city?
Still here. Just give us a minute.
Is there really no-one there that can help you? Have you really, really checked?
We're going to do everything that we can.
It's all right. I ...
Yes, yes, yes, and this - I presume - will be their coffin.
Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I'd say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four. Makes it more likely to be a woman.
A child's coffin would be more expensive. This is in the lower price range, although still best available in that bracket.
This is a practical and informed choice. Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice. Acquainted with the process of death but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal. Also, the lining of the coffin ...
Don't be ridiculous. Look at the coffin. Unmarried, practical about death, alone.
Molly Hooper.
Yes.
What's she doing?
Yes, but why isn't she answering her phone? 
Yes, but it's me calling.
Molly, I just want you to do something very easy for me, and not ask why.
No, it's not a game. I ... need you to help me.
It's not about that.
Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.
I love you.
Molly, no, please, no, don't hang up! Do not hang up!
Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.
Molly, this is for a case. It's ... it's a sort of experiment.
No, I know you're not an experiment. You're my friend. We're friends. But ... please. Just ... say those words for me.
It's very important. I can't say why, but I promise you it is.
Of course you can. Why can't you?
No, I don't know why.
Please, just say it. 
Why?
Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.
Say it anyway.
What?
I-I ... I love you. I love you. Molly? Molly, please.
Eurus, I won. I won. Come on, play fair. The girl on the plane: I need to talk to her. I won. I saved Molly Hooper.
No. No.
This isn't torture; this is vivisection. We're experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats. Soldiers?
Hey, sis, don't mean to complain but this one's empty. What happened? Did you run out of ideas?
Well, what?
Stop it.
Please, for God's sake, just stop it.
Because, on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing. Ignore everything he just said. He's being kind. He's trying to make it easy for me to kill him. Which is why this is going to be so much harder.
Where would you suggest?
Moriarty?
What did they discuss?
Five minutes. It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us. Well, not on my watch.
A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered. I'm remembering the governor. Ten ...
Nine ... Eight ...
Seven ...
Six ...
Five ...
Four ... Three ... Two ...
Yes. Yeah; no, I'm-I'm still here. I'm here.
Yes, I know. Well, I'm sorry about that. We-we-we must have got cut off. Um ... How-how-how long was I away?
No, I-I am telling the truth. You can trust me.
I'm not completely sure. Um, now, I tell you what. You-you've got to be really, really brave for me. Can you go to the front of the plane? Can you do that?
Yes. That's right; the front.
Yes, that's it.
Are you there yet?
John!
Where are you?
I'm in another cell. I just spoke to the girl on the plane again. We've been out for hours.
Yes. The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel. Is Mycroft with you?
Are you okay?
All right. Well, just keep exploring. Tell me anything you can about where you are.
What are you standing on?
What kind of bones?
Redbeard.
Oh, hello. Are you at the front of the plane now?
That's all right. What can you see now?
All right. Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together. Just you and me.
Yeah, there's nothing to it. We just need to get in touch with some people on the ground. Now, um, can you see anything that looks like a radio?
That's all right. Well, we ... keep looking. We've got plenty of time. What's wrong?
It's just turbulence. It's nothing to worry about.
Does the river look like it's getting closer?
All right, then. That means you're nearly home.
Why would there be a well in Sherrinford? Why is there a draught?  Walls don't contract after you've painted them. Not real ones. I'm home. Musgrave Hall.
Yeah, it's just an old building. I don't care. The plane; tell me about the plane NOW! 
Yeah, still not interested. The plane!
Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like.
John.
John. John? Can you hear me? John!
John.
Try as long as possible not to drown.
I'm going to find you. I am finding you!
Eurus, you said the answer's in the song but I went through the song line by line all those years ago and I found nothing. I couldn't find anything. And there-there was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug. I dug and dug and dug and dug. Sixteen feet by six; sixteen yards; sixteen metres - and I found nothing. No-one.
Yes? They're dogs' bones. That's Redbeard.
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Come on, Redbeard!
Victor.
Victor Trevor. We played pirates. I was Yellowbeard and he was ... he was Redbeard.
Oh. Oh God. What ... what did you do?
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Come on, Redbeard!
Victor.
You killed him. You killed my best friend.
Okay. Okay, let's play.
Need your help. I'm trying to solve a puzzle.
Well, the puzzle will save the plane. The wrong dates. She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher and the cipher was the song.
Yes, it is. I'll be with you in a minute.
Hush, now. Working. Let's number the words of the song. Then rearrange the numbered words to match the sequence on the gravestones. I ... am ... lost ... Help ... me ... brother ... Save ... My ... Life ... Before ... my ... Doom. I ... am ... Lost ... Without ... your ... love ... Save ... My ... soul ... seek ... my ... room. Oh God.
I think it's time you told me your real name.
But I'm not a stranger, am I? I'm your brother. I'm here, Eurus.
The game, yes. I get it now. The song was never a set of directions.
Look how brilliant you are. Your mind has created the perfect metaphor. You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land. Now, I'm just an idiot, but I'm on the ground. I can bring you home.
No it's not. It's not too late.
Open your eyes. I'm here. You're not lost any more. Now, you ... you just ... you just went the wrong way last time, that's all. This time, get it right. Tell me how to save my friend. Eurus ... Help me save John Watson.
How is he?
Oh, um. Mycroft - make sure he's looked after. He's not as strong as he thinks he is.
Thanks, Greg.
I said I'd bring her home. I can't, can I?
Is that good?
He did his best.
Oh, there's Daddy!
