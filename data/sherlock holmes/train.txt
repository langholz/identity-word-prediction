He knew your father
Ooh and I think it just vaporised
Mycroft's getting slow
I owe you
Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit
Why has it got two fronts
Thank you yes
Son
Why don't you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them
You've got a scalpel
I pickpocket him when he's annoying
Mm
She's better at this than you
Oh I might as well I'm almost at the bottom of the list
On the contrary I have no view on the matter
Oh yes
You couldn't
friend
Problem
The floor
The first train from Exeter to London leaves at five forty six a.m. You got the first one possible so something important must have happened last night
Posthumous revenge
And the porch where it was smashed I noticed the motion sensor was damaged so I assume it's permanently lit
No I think I'll have the photographs
It's more or less his day job
Did you bring it
You can't even entertain the possibility that they might be right
You
She's perfectly capable of starving us
Bollocks
Lestrade
Me and Janine
So do I
The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel
But from now on there's a new story a bigger adventure
I'm sure that was me
D'you know why
There's nothing you can do and nothing she will do as far as I can see
Who are you
Okay
Who would notice me
You did by every means short of actual speech
That carriage vanished so it must be somewhere
What do you mean more careful
Yes but it's me calling
Carl Powers killed twenty years ago
Magnussen is like a shark it's the only way I can describe him
For instance
Yes
Why can't you
Utility
Well exactly
I asked for a cup of tea
I planted the information for you to find
A child's coffin would be more expensive
I'll be with you in a minute
And of course I hadn't really anticipated that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter
Mm
Cigarette
the Poison Giant
Remind you of anyone Mary
Can you remember the pattern
This has been planned
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments during my absence
The obliquity of the ecliptic
Left to you I would have died
For God's sake
You want me to tell you what you already know
Thank you
Interesting expression
Hello
You're all so vacant
Well you cannot possibly go wrong but erm if you'd like my personal recommendation
So on to some funny stories about John
I'll be in touch
Need your help
Then come Watson come
Tell me why the painting is a fake
It's all right
We could have split the fee
Where no one will look
Doesn't it
It's no fun is it
No I mean you're going to find her dead
Why wouldn't I be
We need to get vehicles get a helicopter
Limited edition two blue stripes nineteen eighty nine

Ancient history
A crisis arose and was dealt with
What
Ticket stubs
Inspector do sit down
I get it now
What
I can't be seen to be wandering around with an old man
Oh I may be on the side of the angels but don't think for one second that I am one of them
It's a gift then
Crossed the dateline twice but he didn't alter it
All right
What what what could I need from you
So I am human I'm not as tall as people think I am
Once you've ruled out the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be true
Psychedelic
Great
Go to the stream
There are a number of aspects I'm still not quite clear on
That woman
I saw it too John
Mmm
A little trace of breadcrumbs hardback copy of fairy tales
Thank you for the final proof
Well anybody who wears a hat as stupid as this isn't in the habit of hanging around other people is he
Oh well because he would have done something about it
He's different so what
No
You know what happened
Oh how are you feeling
Noises can tell you everything
Sorry I I wasn't thinking of Rosie
Oh
It's just turbulence
my hostage
No
Please don't
I need anecdotes
But stealing the plans for the missile defence programme wasn't an accident was it
I'm afraid John
You can see the pen marks over it
I am busy
Keep up
Maybe it's Moriarty
You see
Starter
Merry Christmas Mycroft
Yes
You're trying to stop me to distract me derail me
There's a mile of disused factories between the river and the park
Go away
Once the idea exists it cannot be killed
Naturally
Project HOUND a new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible
A moment ago a brave man asked to be remembered
Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts
John listen
It's a fake
These days only street traders use it
Prime Minister
Why shouldn't he be
Beautiful isn't it
It's obvious from the size of her suitcase
I like company when I go out and I think better when I talk aloud
Let's play something different
Oh I don't know
Who do we trust even though we don't know them
Thanks for the hug
Of course he does tend to romanticise things a bit but then you know he's a romantic
I'm no expert but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months that the relationship was no longer intimate
Suffocating me overdosing me
Dead
Tell us where you are
The computer code is key to this
He's got my whole life story
Next
Why did he need her expertise
Between us we could afford them
I'm still catching up with my brain
No fingerprints
If somebody had just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that but the murderer would panic
But the sound of breaking glass
Really
I can't see the pattern
Get a sample sent to the lab
Nice trip
And the shot that killed him was it fired from his own gun
When's the next one
I'm extremely calm
The game is on
No
Keep your hands off it
Well the question is where is her phone now
You've been letting things slide Graham
Nothing whatsoever
I don't know the code
Laser surgery
Please
No no no after that
Miss Adler I presume
See you've shaved it off then
The rest was just window dressing
The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast
Ah yes
Harry Watson clearly a family member who's given you his old phone
The next of the thirteen possibilities
It's all right John
Is that a fact
Now er
Leave it
Alone
Oh my God
Isn't that right Mary
It's for someone special then
However sentiment got the better of you
No it's not
Get off
This one's brand new
High functioning sociopath with your number
There has to be
She
How did you know
Oh apparently yes
I love you
What have you been doing
Watson
Watson
You're dealing with a killer who can climb
I concede it
What are you gonna do throw it
Yes but now that it's up here I can use it to alter all the records
No
They're both too big for him so some kind of standard issue uniform
I have to go back
If she'd died she'd still be there
Hmm
He's saved mine so many times and in so many ways
I am taking it seriously
No
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs Ricoletti for the corpse in the morgue
Don't wanna use mine
Get this right and there's a headless nun in it for you
Tramway
Love ginger nuts
Transcriber's note Your humble transcriber is so anally obsessed with the accuracy of her transcripts that normally she would type every single instance of what follows carefully counting every Not you and the location of the woman to whom Sherlock says it
It goes straight to his penthouse and office
Hope we can get a cab from here
To specific pages and specific words on those pages
Fine
Bohemian stationery an assassin named after a Prague legend and you Miss Wenceslas
Always Sally
Somebody's been in here before me
Mary no human action is ever truly random
For God's sakes John
And then behold someone turns up and spills all the beans
Really I'm so sorry Mr Welsborough Mrs Welsborough
This is my turn
It's your day off
Eurus let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like
Watson give the inspector what he so clearly wants
I don't know how but they're not suicides they're killings serial killings
Doesn't mean I know how to defuse a giant bomb
People have died
Conclusion two my sister Eurus apparently has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother
Owes me a favour
of the whole street
It fits
How long
Only the cipher can tell us
Yes I am
My phone
Piss off
You didn't find me for another five minutes
The card stops working
Thank you
Taking it from who
Yes but I'm not my brother remember
Actually I'd better skip the coffee
It's difficult to say quite what he'll do
Look
All except Sherlock Holmes
Hmm
I was there
John
Something's missing from here but only recently
Whenever she tweets you respond within five minutes regardless of time or current location suggesting you have her on text alert
Know the author
Do it quickly
You're going to have to be more specific Craig
I didn't see anything
I haven't finished yet
Applause
D'you mind
There's always something
Okay
Mrs Hudson took my skull
Oh
Let's concentrate
Will you help me
I might as well ask you why you've started cycling to work
After what
Can you print me up a copy
Who the hell are you
I need to know I was right then I'll be sure
Oh you mean it's actually Christmas
Yeah
Ah let's see if I can recall
Mmmmmm no she doesn't
Boring
What happened to the lipstick
Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping
Sorry
No I need you to go to the police station
From the million pound security system at the bank to the PIN machine you took exception to cryptography inhabits our every waking moment
It's obvious
Am I wrong
Have you put on weight
The game's afoot
Your initiative
Faith stop loitering at the door and come in
If I wanted to understand what would I do
She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours
They'll be deciding
Keeping up appearances but not planning ahead
You've got a psychosomatic limp of course you've got a therapist
It registers as corrupted
I made up the bit about glowing
Oh good
No
But I don't work for free
They provide a very special service
Address
You were just a child so you rationalised it into something very different
Look
Not real ones
I told you
Well on your salary it would have to be modest and you spent all the money on that cottage didn't you and what are you widowed or divorced
Don't worry this is just stupid
It means when the police are out of their depth which is always they consult me
I am a show off
It's probably your first trip to London right going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you
Just let me do this
he ended up in custody
You were a doctor
Oh yes of course
Bored
Thank you
The right sleeve of your jacket plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch
Blood
What do you mean
The the style it's usually parted in the middle
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again I might as well say it now
Are you at the front of the plane now
The plane remember
It was a case a famous one from a hundred years ago lodged in my hard drive
Mary and I think seven
Connection connection connection
I am fine
You see what
Who needs me this time
Then there's your brother
That was this morning
The train napkin that you used to mop up the spilled coffee the strength of the stain shows that you didn't take milk
Two men who travelled back from China were murdered and their killer left them messages in the Hangzhou numerals
The game Mrs Hudson is on
Wrong
It was hidden on me hidden inside my head a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system
We have to find her
Oh God
Explain
Course I can
He's a serial killer
Bit risky wasn't it
Been at the scratch cards again
Currently he's going home alone
I need you to know John I need you to see that up here
Mm hm
I am pleased
What case
I cracked this code all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book
I'm chatting
Killing me that's so two years ago
One murder one nearly murderer
That's a little more difficult to explain
Wasn't worried
What
I'm beginning to think you're not
Here we go then
He's been working for North Korea since #
We're still here
So you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them
Nasty wound
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start
I know
Ah Molly coffee
This place is never going to trouble Egon Ronay is it
Come on
Ah process of elimination
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it
Now look the sun's only struck the bottom two thirds but the line is straight so that means we know the paper is facing the window
Did seem very real and she gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere
Promise
The girl female handwriting's quite distinctive
If I couldn't solve it before how can I solve it now
I thought perhaps you might have found yourself a goldfish
I was road testing
What are you doing here
The bomber knew him admitted that he knew him
How much can you remember it
Double oh seven double oh seven what what something what
I'm intrigued
The more he acquires the greater his wealth and power
Why would you care
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked
Er what was I going to say
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara
but it's more about how he did it
Keep your eyes on it
Flying all the way round the world twice in a month
Come on
John
A what
Only with a tranquilliser
It's called Pepper's Ghost
Claudette I No no I know it's been hard for you Claudette listen to me
In my opinion yes
You're afraid that you've been taken in as well
We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved
Sometimes it's so o o hard not smoking
Sorry what dinner
Go on
I have been reliably informed that I don't have one
Redbeard
To the very best of times John
No it's the uh it's the burglar
I never guess
Thank you
Least not until it's been cleared
I really wasn't
The picture's a fake
Thanks again
I will stop you
Look
Moriarty
I saw you
The room's small
And I die in disgrace
Frankland
Point made
Vinyl's cheaper than leather
Oh he must have done
No
What did you think
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie
Worth nine million pounds
An organisation
Maybe it's your turn
What
Show me the grass
Not any more
Get out
Well you'd know
Yes it's an AGRA memory stick like you gave John except this one belongs to someone else
Bit awkward this
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room
Still here
I had of course several other backup plans
Are you wearing lipstick
Mrs Hudson
I apologise
Yes
You stalk a deer with a hat
You've never been the most luminous of people but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable
We have a client
Definitely avoid that
Your visit
Like what
Either way the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone
Wise advice I'll certainly try to bear in mind
Course it's Moriarty
What was what
Meanwhile back to business
Points
That's it
Those things'll kill you
The solution of course was simple
Kidnapping
Oh yes
Lestrade you're spoiling us
I know ashtray
A book that everybody would own
Intuitions are not to be ignored John
Why were you so frightened
There's no signal on mine
I know what you're doing
I love those
Think about what Sebastian told us about Van Coon about how he stayed afloat in the market
Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles
Is it about me
How did you get that
Wake up
I need to talk to an expert
It's over now
You look well
Maybe he took it from her for some reason
The missile defence plans haven't left the country otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it
Not always so easy
Double oh seven double oh seven double oh seven double oh seven something something connected to double oh seven What
Sorry what
Don't spend it all in one crack den
No
Look at the gap
Ah Mr Prince isn't it
I knew I knew your name
The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires
You're worried they're right
Stick with Janine
You made it all possible
Don't worry putting my best man onto it
Consulting
Stupid
Professional person going by her clothes I'm guessing something in the media going by the frankly alarming shade of pink
Good job I'm not one of them
Get to the Hollow
Get Sherlock
No
I'm hardly in the dog one
You said that
John stays
N now
Why
Nobody thought so nobody except me
I never said he was alive
Appledore
She understands very little
The Woman
No
I'm just going to find them but you're moderately clever and we've got a moment so let's pass the time
What
I've figured it out
Now talk and sort it out
Liberty in death isn't that the expression
I was on a jet
What
I'm unarmed
John look at this
No no no I can get this
Then there's the style of the flight number zero zero seven that eliminates a few more and assuming a British point of origin which would be logical considering the original source of the information and assuming from the increased pressure on you lately that the crisis is imminent the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the six thirty to Baltimore tomorrow evening from Heathrow Airport
Why not
Who is supposed to have shot him then
It's all on the website
He fell out of a window
Now listen you must go home immediately
The last thing I need is a public image
Somebody else
Involved
Er be my guest
It's perfectly all right
What's one more stranger among that lot
If this gets any better I'm gonna get two knives
Medals Distinguished Service Order
Still beautiful though
And I said dangerous and here you are
Not good
Where are you
This is Angelo
Your husband was executed for double murder
You never felt pain did you
I am on fire
Our bomber's repeated himself
No no please
I'll have the gun please
Course he's the killer
Smallish case going by the spread
Valuable antiquities John
Henry
Hush Watson
Done
Thumbnail tiny traces of foil
Too much time spent on dancing lessons
I don't have to die if I've got you
Not now
I won't insult your intelligence by explaining it to you
And there there was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug
Try to picture what you saw
Help get Mrs Hudson out too
I was wasn't I
Major James Sholto
No
Helps me to think
I love dancing
Oh come on Kitty
What you didn't know Mary was that this one also tipped off the hostage takers
What
What
What about you
No habits hobbies personality
More likely
Can you hear me
In the planetarium
Thank you for bringing this to my attention
Very good
Yes
You put that there to test me
Eurus I don't remember you at all
Yeah
It's very useful to me
Two hours later he comes up to London the poison takes effect paralyses the muscles and he drowns
I upset her
I give in
Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night
Perfume
Now you you just you just went the wrong way last time that's all
Shh
Haven't the faintest
Don't compromise the integrity of the
Let me introduce Amo
Jeanette
Well who else am I missing
Go to your right
In all your Facebook photographs of the happy couple Mary takes centre frame whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded
Really Lestrade
Everything's fine
Maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept
Excellent
All of them from an anonymous source
A grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard
Just saving you the trouble of asking
I've nearly been in contact so many times but
Not to date anyone with a Navy
Sorry your engagement's over though I'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring
Oh God
She phoned first
Missile plans are out of the country now
She's fast when she's cleaning
Go on search me
It's next on the list
Your best friend is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high
Why did he need to visit his sister
Ten years old at least
Raoul the houseboy
Call me later
Er may I have a look at your camera
Very old friend of your husband's
I say jealousy was your motive after all to prove how good you are to make up for the inadequacies of your little life
John
It's a church
I had some at the Palace
Mmm yes
Three hundred millilitres of it
This is you isn't it
Exploding star only appeared in the sky in eighteen fifty eight
They tend to be quite young
Listen
I don't know how he does it so I can't stop him and that means he'll do it again
She's my friend and she's under my protection
I said he was back
Please
It's very important
Why
It's what people do don't they leave a note
You and I we barely scratched the surface
Sounded like she was torturing an owl
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat on the edge of a precipice you're going in the water short arse
the crack in the lens
Mary and John will be extremely d
Oh no no no no no we're fine
Her real name is Greta Bengtsdotter
Past tense did you notice
Thank you
Go find out where he is and pick him up
You're reading
What are you standing on
Breathing's boring
It's time to come back
Your wife just texted you
And Mrs Hudson will remember you
Moriarty slipped up
Get out
Evidently
You've been in Afghanistan I perceive
Sherlock Holmes
Good
I referred to her husband in the past tense
Have you ever heard of the Golem
Might not be peas
However before you do allow me to make some trifling observations
Hmm
Plaster busts of The Iron Lady drying
No you're quite right
No
Why
Don't we
I also knew that the bomber had given us twelve hours
Million
Neat
Here we go then
Oh yeah
It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor
Access all areas
Any second now you're going to
The answer's no
Yes of course I am
To the museum to the restoration room
Unless the contents of this phone are provably unique you wouldn't be able to sell them
A man
First mistake
Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children's homes in north England
Flattered
Not any more though
I took it from Henry's kitchen his sugar
Mm
You don't mind do you
Is that it
You sent her a text or or or technically I sent her a text but she's not to know
Coventry all over again
No not a case no no no
Bravo
Bet's off John sorry
So what was it he was looking for
Come on then
Of course
Nice observational skills Billy
He needed to do more than kill you
Find out who Rachel is
They do grow up so fast
I'll text instructions
These are seat allocations on a passenger jet
We're going to do everything that we can
You smell of disinfectant now
It really bothers you
Not just a criminal organisation it's a cult
Tell me
How
Interesting
There's a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left
I don't know
Okay it's not a great defence
Empty thanks to you
It's on the tip of my tongue
Five minutes
That was a mistake
Requires quite a bit of contortion
I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend
Yeah okay
Phew
You have an impish sense of humour which currently you're deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish
Have you got any cash
I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised
Um I've just been attacked um and um I think they they took my wallet and um and my phone
These are my rats John
And Lukis was the same a journalist writing about China
They're all quite old now which suggests he's been unemployed for some time
Oh
Name
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man
No
No
It's where I began
What d'you mean more than a man
Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in
You're leading the witness
No sign
Well I decline
Look I've got a blanket
There has to be
I I don't think we've met
Well this has been very interesting
If you could estimate approximate volume discharged
No I know you're not an experiment
Coventry
He writes the blog
The game is afoot
Stop the cab
Okay I learned it on YouTube
Same old drudge day in day out never getting out there where all the excitement was
They wanted to use it as an anti personnel weapon to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus but they shut it down and hid it away in #
It's too heavy
Here John
John
But I know a man who can
It's physically painful watching you thinking
Northumberland Street's a five minute walk from here
Doesn't make any sense
Now barely a hundred people had seen that invitation
Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson
Why would he date all of those women and not return their calls
I'll let you know if I notice
Good evening Mycroft
I've written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres
I have work to do
Lestrade will give you the address
Only explanation of all the facts
What
I pulled a gun he tried to blow me up
It's very promising
Four people are dead
Goodnight Mycroft
Sherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds
However it would probably make for very boring reading and so for speed convenience and the nurturing of very sore typing fingers suffice it to say that this scene continues for a long time with Sherlock dismissing woman after woman each of whom sits down
And you saw nothing
I don't need those any more
He did didn't he
That's not it
No it can't
Hello
Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives
Of course there is
The passcode
And my client is
Excellent
Is that supposed to convince me
Well obviously I lost that round although technically I did solve the case
Did you bring any morphine
Now where is it
The gun
You were enjoying it
Stop it
I was really worried
So I went straight ahead and moved in
Quite recently I'd say
There's a unifying factor
Did you keep the envelope
Ancient crime syndicate based in China
Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night
Lethal
Not a monster
Of course
I've got something that all of them want but if one of them approaches me
Perhaps the truth
Well Home Secretary actually
Not in front of everyone
The point I'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant rude ignorant and all round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet
Me either
Flabby
Before you gave it to John did you keep your memory stick safe
It has to be
Whatever was stolen he wants it back
So the numbers are references
Then talk to me in your own voice
Why
No
I'm still trying to understand it
Sebastian
This gentleman is my guest
But there was something wrong something I couldn't get out of my head
Why
When the vacuum stops we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat
Never are
Go and see
Hmm
And can I use your balcony
But then you started to remember so you had to be stopped driven out of your mind so that no one would believe a word that you said
John
Nothing there
Where did the plane take off
You've got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy
Nobody getting in and nobody getting out
I needed to look inside his wallet
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars
Jump off
The universe is rarely so lazy
Hannibal Wellington Rommel Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples all four volumes
I felt doubt
Facile
Hmm
Ignore all of that
A meat dagger
Off to Devon with you have a cream tea on me
If someone could move Mrs Hudson's glass just slightly out of reach that would be lovely
Suppose a sugar high's some sort of substitute
I hope you'll be very happy Molly Hooper
Molly
Mmm
An apology
Boring boring boring no
No I'm not
Once we're mobile how long before detonation
I dunno
Not exactly Fort Knox
Connie Prince's background family history everything
It's abandoned wouldn't you say
I'm not
Either will do
What have you done with my secret supply
So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China
My friend John Watson
Don't make me do it out here
Thousands of people pass by there every day
If we retrace their steps somewhere they'll coincide
It's very very disappointing
Raoul de Santos is your killer
What kind of a boss was he Amanda
What's the matter with you this evening
Don't be ridiculous
Any good
The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat so he's mawkishly attached to it but it's more than that
Lends distinction to friends and anonymity to waiters
Everybody wants to believe it that's what makes it so clever
So your favourite room the mortuary
Richard Brook
That's a semi automatic
Nice
Where are we going now
Course I called the police
Need your help
The painting is a fake but how can I prove it
He's killed another one
No I think he's brilliant enough
What what am I
Sherlock Holmes
Ah the photographer
That's why he left that message telling everyone where to come
You have been drugged
Well just keep exploring
Isn't that right Lady Carmichael
If you could all just cheer up a bit that would be better
A clone a super dog
Do you have a secret you've never told anyone
Well you've changed
Now there are two
Clever
I'm gonna walk around shake things up a bit
Couldn't see a way out
Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion
I didn't know I noticed
Secret door
He gave us his number in case we needed him
That's what you do when you sell a big lie you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable
I will keep you safe
Mycroft promised to take them to a matinee of Les Mis
It's more common than you'd think
The most interesting case for months
I wonder why
What kind of bones
I need to get to know the place again breathe it in feel every quiver of its beating heart
You hate Christmas
No I don't understand
Examples
Have a seat
Leading
I have no idea
Yes
I have never been so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost
Next bit's easy
I prefer to do my own editing
Who is Brook
Tbilisi was six years ago
That's not really my style
The plane
So's Magnussen
Besides I have the strangest feeling
Who are you
Seen a lot of injuries then violent deaths
You find yourself in a workshop
You're having lunch with me
No stopping them apparently
Do you own an American car
No no no don't look like that
The fact that you know it's going to happen isn't going to stop it
Obviously irritating him and bleeding
How
No one
Photographs of whom
Probably all signed confidentiality agreements
I was relying on that
But you were right
What people
I am utterly
And you've solved it already I assume
I'll be right behind
The sole of the shoe is like a passport
You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service and nerves of steel Actually do you know what
She seemed to be dead but then she came back
Please forgive me
I'm a user
Ready
There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph but can go anywhere and even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes and you never even see his face
I'll remember
She likes to feel involved
James Moriarty is for hire
Refined cold blooded murder
But more importantly
Definitely not
No no no
Found this inside his trouser pockets
Mm maybe
The car seats
They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases
Ten
Breadcrumbs
Is there
It narrows it down from just anyone in London
John
No
Taking your own life
It's designed to beguile me tease me lure me in
How is he
Eight so far
Is that her file
Oh
American
You're not going to do it
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data the future would be entirely calculable as inevitable as mathematics
There goes Sir Eustace
It's a start
Hmm
No
God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend
Morbidly obese the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own the right sleeve of an internet porn addict and the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition
I'm Sherlock Holmes
It's all been explained to you hasn't it explained very carefully
six months old
Thank you so much
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me however
What are you doing here
That's all right
Helping me make a point
This is where it was smashed
And the game is on
Yes good
It'd be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication
Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once
Hi
You have a magnificent brain Moriarty
What noise
Even at the eleventh hour it's not too late you know
Either way you're wasted as a cabbie
Mrs Hudson I'll be late
Oh for God's sake
Thank you Billy
Afternoon
You would
I've been cooped up in here for ages
Oh
I'm against new people
Your wife is a spy
That is gorgeous
Having fun
Just saving her time
Very nice yes good
What are you doing
Shot herself in the head exactly like Moriarty
That's why they were killed
Is that it
Presumably you downsized when you when you left your job and maybe when you ended your relationship
Apply enough pressure and it momentarily cuts off the pulse
The floor above
I do not have a drug habit
Yeah very much so
I'll be waiting
Oh for God's sakes
Scuse me coming through
Well they won't be interested in us
I'm afraid it's far worse than that
Slow but sure John not dissimilar to yourself
My name is Sherlock Holmes
Fifteen
Probably best not to do any arm spraining but we'll see how the night goes
I saw the hound saw it as my imagination expected me to see it a genetically engineered monster
So what do I what do I what d'you want me to do at the end
Doctor Watson what do you think
Nothing of importance
Say that again
Just arriving at the Secure Unit
You think she's my girlfriend because I'm X raying her possessions
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed
Elegant
Yes
Billy Kincaid the Camden Garrotter
Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library
The boy suffered from eczema
Together we ought to be able to afford it
Wasn't a real man
Yeah that that
I take it you've stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house
Safest place I know
Not rush hour check the time
There see
Come on look at it
What
Everyone got that from a book
Oh for God's sakes
Are you doing it
I want everything you've got on Mary
Suitcase yes
Come on
To somewhere near Piccadilly Station
Pale and trembling the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many many miles to the city of Samarra for there he was sure Death could not find him
Well
Wish your family could have seen this
Yes
So on to some funny stories
Belly Button Murders
Sentiment
The girl where is she
Well it was the only possible solution
I think it's time you told me your real name
No
He hates it
Yes boring
Not many Van Coons in the phonebook
Lurid
We met twice five minutes in total
The Bloody Guardsman
I need something stronger than tea
I know nothing
I'm not sweet I'm just high
Yes
What do you mean
Can I talk to her again
Well your booby trap did just kill a man
Pity
Careful
You'd think that he'd led a sedentary life yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise
Obviously
Yes
The inexplicable
Spot on then
Woodbridge knew but how
The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned but not her wedding ring
Boring
Dunno
I dug and dug and dug and dug
Off it
The British and American governments know about it but rather than expose the source of that information they're going to let it happen
Oh come on
John Magnussen is all that matters now
Turn around and walk back the way you came now
I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling and I'm never climbing out
Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook
It was worth a try
Brought you a little getting to know you present
You're on sparkling form
All of the attention is focussed on me
How
When was the last time that you saw her
I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity
But there's something else
Oh
Not cash no
Oh I don't know
How will that help
Five of them are behaving perfectly normally but the sixth
No it's not a game
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his locker but there was no sign of his shoes until now
It's the only possible explanation
Hey bro
And John's great too
I've no idea why
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive
Oh dear Lord
Tell us from the start
And then everyone got to work
Not tonight
Hundreds of casualties but nobody dies
Very neatly
Well I mean the British government or whatever government you're currently propping up
That was um good
I'm Sherlock Holmes
Don't Tell Me I Don't
That's not what happened at all
There's not a moment to lose
He's with me
Now shut up and smoke
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis
Look behind his back
Three
Thank God that's over
Ladies and gentlemen can't stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once Vatican Cameos
Yes
Hound
To the morgue
Before Bluebell disappeared it turned luminous like a fairy according to little Kirsty then the next morning Bluebell was gone
I didn't say it was funny
Glowing
Thank you
The wheel turns
He is
The bride and groom
Proving it's just the detail
Both
I don't know
Yesterday end of term parents milling around chauffeurs staff
Mmm am I important
Woman
because we don't have enough of that already apparently
TRAMWAY
Will you give me time
What d'you reckon
antiquities sold at auction
Irene Adler
What is that
There's a loose thread in the world
Did it
My investigation was the fantasy
What are you doing here
What kind of a doctor are you
I didn't know you spoke Serbian
Sure
Save John Watson
Come on come on
I don't understand
Well you could just sit there and watch telly
Right
Really
And where are you going
Sss Crime something or other
The bomber's too smart for that
You mean me
Are you having an earthquake
But your conversation as you entered the room
Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge
If you increase the dosage four or five times toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour
Dance
That was their first mistake
Raising glasses and standing up
We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight so she must have come a decent distance but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried
No it's because you emptied it
It's a fake
Enjoy it
Come on John
Don't worry Mary I have been tutoring him
It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals and none of it is on a computer
Keep me informed
There are four additional units wired inside the casing I suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive
There's not a moment to lose
Oh I sent and deleted a text
Just curious
Tea
Yes
Haven't you seen the posters
Yes
Sure
He's the Big Rat
So the shooter
Was
Smile and wink
No it's fine
Oh
You didn't even bring a coat in this rain
John I need some
Guilty
Getting to that
Always him
Don't be absurd
That's a new dress but there's flour on the sleeve
Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck are your own
Not you
Its roots were everywhere like a cancer so we came up with a plan
Today we honour the death watch beetle that is the doom of our society and in time one feels certain our entire species
This is the canteen
Interesting
What's new about this one
You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner but he's so much more than that
Yes well as I was saying dull
So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed
Twice in this case
Your daughter Faith's walking cane
I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed
There's a difference
Go for a stroll
Nothing
Punch me in the face
You killed him
How
Good morning
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park
Oh I am playing
Right then
She's not the one
You do count
It's odd isn't it
A deal with the devil
You all right
That door didn't open last night
Yes and then he stole the Crown Jewels broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break at Pentonville
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed
How did you get in
What is that
Speed was paramount
Why would you be giving me a clue
Dunno
Very few places you can see that graffiti from
Oh you've changed
Won't be long
Now for the last time if you want to keep the rattle do not throw the rattle hm
Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan
You're very determined about it
This is different
The Black Pearl of the Borgias
Where are they
Saline
Just enter the number
He's never wrong
It gets boring if I just solve them all
Why did you never feel pain
Very silly
Oh yes
But he works at Baskerville
Thatcher
I know you care about her deeply
He was On second thoughts I probably should have told you about the Elephant in the Room
John
So he disguises himself steals the man's home steals his identity
Get another one
Okay
I was in the middle of a case Mycroft
Come on John
No you're not a vegetable
I wear the damn hat
A message what they were trying to reclaim
Excuse me for a second
I myself know of at least fifty eight techniques to refine this seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables
Oh I see
It's the fog
Okay
Treat her like royalty Mycroft
Her daughter
John Watson who while I was trying to solve the murder instead saved a life
They found a body just like Molly Hooper found a body for me when I Yeah well we don't need to go into all that again do we
Was she Connie's
I don't work here you see
Probably a fluorescent gene removed and spliced into the specimen
I can vouch for this man
Might need some food
Couple of others
Karim would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world
Let him do what he wants
John Watson
It is a game Lestrade and not one I'm willing to play
Precise details in the last week what's been cleaned
The fog
I'm sorry
So clearly you remember me
No
Then there's the nicotine stains on your fingers your shaking fingers
I've just been having a very fruitful chat with people who loved this show
Excellent
What
Where did it go
He's a man and good at it
He didn't know its value didn't know why they were chasing him
Don't feel singled out Mrs Hudson
How when and why
Okay tell me this your sponsor
Don't be so hard on yourself
You looked surprised
We both saw it saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it
I can't do it John
Or a genetic experiment
I can't come down so we'll we'll just have to do it like this
There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve
No
Definitely
Like I said human error
Oh noises are important
This room was in darkness
But I'll tell you one thing that lost Vermeer painting's a fake
There was once a merchant in the famous market at Baghdad
Too late to go on the record
Page five column six first sentence
Carl Powers John
Cover your face and walk fast
She phoned the ambulance
The League of Furies
I've got Bluebell
Is that news to you
Met a friend of yours
Possibly
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this but let's avoid the court case
She must have had a phone or an organiser
One of them helps himself to something a little hairpin
All right Craig
This is this is horrible isn't it
You said your life turned on one word
Hang on weren't there other people
Interesting
What
You are fantastic
No no good
She's boring
If it's about the Leeds triple murder it was the gardener
Mary whatever he's got on you let me help
Interesting
You've isolated yourself
Oh look at you lot
No reason not to
No she never got to the hotel
Mm
Needs work Watson
Father and son Barrymore senior
You were showing the world what you can do
whoa whoa
So I gather
Small but athletic
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME
That should bring things to a head
Offensive
All your little puzzles making me dance all to distract me from this
Tut tut
Of course you can
Quite a gambler that woman
That's why he stays
Tell me
Mm
When she got out of the car she knew that she was going to her death
So Ajay survived as well and now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide with all of AGRA's old aliases on it
Right um First things first
I can't stop it
I can't find Bluebell anywhere
I nearly had it
Exit visas are scarce in China
Yeah still not interested
Any interest in her
Anyway time to go and be Sherlock Holmes
Nope
Come on
It's me
I lack the practical experience
Sometimes it's not a question of Who
It's not about that
John
The owner loved these
What are you
Helps me think
Here have a look
I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory so you tried it again later
Can't have been easy all those years sitting in the back keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room
Why is it clever
They're always so desperate to get caught
The crossbow's on a delicate string
I have to drink a cup of tea
We might have a long wait
Building site
Well
STOP LAUGHING AT ME
America
You saw those pipes pretty ancient leaky as a sieve and they were carrying the gas so Um ketchup was it or brown
Anyway you've got things to do
Conclusion relationship
D'you do block bookings
She threatened to disinherit Kenny
Why hasn't he phoned
Three two one go
Don't want to get ill. That would ruin it spoil the mood
But what if it's not a word
And this is just losing
Yes
I know you've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him possibly because he's an alcoholic more likely because he recently walked out on his wife
Who
So far so obvious
Shh
Coat
I see someone who's hungry
He's a doctor
I explained to him that I'd never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it
I need to concentrate and I don't want to hit you
I'm sure you've acquainted yourself with them before now
Barely scratched the surface
I'm Sherlock
No
Yes I know
Vatican cameos
I'm a mess I'm in hell but I am not wrong not about him
This is childish
In England
Serial killing is an expression of power ego a signature in human destruction
Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures of course
You're closer
True
The stage is set and the curtain rises
Oh a power play
And what happened when you went back to Dewer's Hollow last night Henry
Now go
Tight belt worn high on the waist
Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake
How are you feeling
Mrs Hudson
So do you
THERE ARE NO GHOSTS
Er
You did go to prison
And
Why are you telling us what may be presumed
No
You're in charge aren't you Miss Wenceslas
Oh for God's sakes
Well there you are you see
I just
Her gravestone is in Chiswick Cemetery where five years ago you acquired her name and date of birth and thereafter her identity
Me
Well the puzzle will save the plane
Who's talking
Ohhh I should think like this
I admire it
John I am a ridiculous man redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship
I love you
Definitely
Brilliant isn't it
I'm going to monitor the underworld every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move
Got to the jury of course
SHUT UP
He's hungry all right and not well off you can tell that by the state of his cuffs and shoes
Oddly enough no
Except his shoe size his height his gait his walking pace
It is
Gavin
I'm you aren't I
He's giving me time
What
What's the matter
Yes
That would suggest long term hopes however forlorn and that she's seeing him tonight is evident from her make up and what she's wearing
No this way
You said Hamish
It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like and how you and I might fit inside it
That journey took ten minutes ten minutes to get from Westminster to St James's Park
Er w A a also
Oh well that was Ian
Families fall out
This picture's straightened every day yet this ugly gap remains
There are going to be others
Okay
Yes I'm going out with Janine
John
That's really not a good question
A simple reflection in glass of a living breathing person
Ladies and gentlemen just er one last thing before the evening begins properly
Well that's the knighthood in the bag
Van Coon was left handed
Er I'm sorry I mean I mean two of you
Yeah that's what I just noticed
Just an old theatrical trick
I'm not talking from down ere
But the wound's clean very clean and fresh
They're always poor and lonely and strange
Lestrade
Exactly
Molly no please no don't hang up
No
Mother our mother
These words exactly What happened at Lauriston Gardens
Biding my time
I'm not a hero
the East winds blow
I've absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off
Maximum pressure just under the half second
The Mayfly Man
Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side
Not a window
It's like a reflex
I delete his texts
Did you know there were other people after her too Mycroft before you sent John and I in there
Hmm
I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive
But he got his eyes fixed
Love what
I know what
Now I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me and in this very room you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington the Poisoner
NINE MILL FOR JADE PIN DRAGON DEN BLACK
Obviously the letters no longer have any practical use to you so with that in mind Something I said
People are stupid
It's the first cipher
Positionofthecar Er the position of the car relative to the hiker at the time of the backfire
The only true freedom
On the night that both of us broke into the building your own husband would become a suspect so you calculated that Magnussen would use the fact of your involvement rather than sharing the information with the police as is his M.O
Something in his past
I don't text her back
John man the door
Don't you worry about a thing
Isn't that kinder
End of story
Moron
Speech
Are you all right
Additionally serial killers are easily profiled
Moriarty is dead no question
He's thinking
Just get out
So I texted her
Without that my brain rots
Ooh
Oh I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn't prove you'd seen the hound
It'll come back to me
Now if you just wanted to smoke indoors you would have invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things but you're convinced you can give up so you don't want to buy a pipe because that means you're not serious about quitting so instead you buy individual cigarettes always sure that each will be your last
I don't don't want to die
But they take the poison themselves they chew swallow the pills themselves
Look at the coffin
She's just a hostage
What did you just say
There's nothing to find
Yes
Wrong toilet
Henry
What are you talking about
This is about Mary
Yes obviously
John
Did you see him
Is that what you think of me
Humphrey
It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us
No connection
It kept ringing
God forbid the star witness at the trial should come across as intelligent
He's dead
Okay fine
STOP LAUGHING AT ME
John there's something
You have a police force of sorts even a marginally Secret Service
Look here's another one
I've been thinking about you
Wiggins is an excellent chemist
The airbag needed to be got out of the way just as John cleared the station
Somewhere in #B somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden
I saw you die
One condition
So how was it done
I can wait until the hospital
He's an idiot
Clear as a map reference to me
There's no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven
Why would I be tweeting
Don't you want it
Lestrade another one
You're not a soldier
Much more
The smudge is deliberate to see if I'm as good as they say I am
I'm not sure I like it now
Some things are best left to the imagination Mrs Hudson
And is your wife away for long
Sorry that was one more deduction than I was really expecting
Oh breathing
Bided his time then upped the strength to a fatal dose
Obvious
Not much industry in this part of the world so he's turned to his widowed mother for help
teacher
Finally he had enough fell out with her badly
Anyway it's time for dancing
First test passed it would seem
Err Er beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions influences and role models
You talk to the dead
How do you feel about the violin
I understand your disapproval Watson but if he's feeling competitive it is perfectly within his power to die early
Hang on a minute
But how
Toby's not the hacker
Built in flash drive
Oh for God's sake
Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing
Close enough
Because you won't like it
What did you say after that
Apparently
I know it's him
There's a pinprick at the top of the paper
I see
Um something to do with murder at the zoo
Well obviously I can um straighten things up a bit
You thought that
In a minute
Your life is not your own
A facade
The glycerol molecule
Rat Number One
Well you're hardly gonna need me around now that you've got a real baby on the way
You've got a solution that you like but you're choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it
John
I need to know
Not the murderer no
No I know you don't but your employer does
A case so sensational you hoped I'd be interested
Look this is a six
Very good to meet you
I know it's fine
And because you're dying you've just murdered four people
She doesn't work with her hands so what or rather who does she remove her rings for
What's he doing working his way round the world
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it
Though do in fact shut up
Who is she
Tall
View of the Thames
I'll just be myself
I'll find the answer
Get Anderson
Good
Every beat is a one every rest is a zero
Little bit funny
I don't need an incentive Sebastian
I assumed
You invited her
Surprisingly okay
Shhh
Okay two bottles
And I can't even remember what for
Sorry I'm not sure I completely understand
Do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us
here today
A glittering career
Why should you
One photograph that's his next move
Eurus is coming and uh someone's disabled all your security
We'll meet there tomorrow evening seven o'clock
You're the only other survivor
But I don't
And the watch helps too
First big mistake
It's for men
You should have driven faster
And yet over a distance of six feet you failed to make a kill shot
The children's mother has been cut out of the picture
Yeah
Is this you again
But why
Its whole body was glowing
There's no way he could have taken that shot from three hundred metres away
On my desk the number
John
Oh you meant spectacularly ignorant in a nice way
Traces of two leading brands of deodorant both advertised for their strength suggestive of a chronic body odour problem manifesting under stress
Let no one in
You remember the little girl who was abducted by Moriarty
Oh would you would you mind if I just waited here just until they come
And when will that be
Well well
You didn't glimpse it
Next
D'you want me to go on
We've been here before
Night night
Ahh
That doesn't even mean anything
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for the last twenty four hours
I have high hopes for you Inspector
Neat don't you think
I always know when the game is on
This way
Okay
Somehow this is part of his scheme
Can you picture it
Because I took your pulse
He was being threatened
Perfect opportunity and look at that one
What can you see
New label
Okay you've got questions
Listen what I said before John
Well we keep looking
What was that
I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything
You remember John
Superficial
We're being watched
Oh um
Oh by the way the recordings will probably be inadmissible
Posthumous game
Not in this flat not in this room
You took your time
He's been a bit naughty
Won't be trying that again
Pets do that or so I'm told and there's clearly no one new in your life otherwise you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium
Miss me
Do people like me
I need to know where she was buried
She had an item in her possession one she said her life depended on
Yes well he's a very tangible ghost
Yes that's it
Pray continue with your fascinating narrative
Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover's nasty sister
Three years ago is that when they told you
You follow
Because on balance even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing
Similar but very distinctive if you know what you're looking for
Wait
Here boy
Aren't there usually biscuits
That's all right
What kind of a plane are you on
The game's something
You're a man who couldn't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den and beating up a junkie
John
Now show me the car that backfired
Would anyone like to make a guess
I can't
I'm so sorry
I think you're going to find Irene Adler tonight
John
John you have endured war and injury and tragic loss so sorry again about that last one so know this today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved in short the two people who love you most in all this world
I'm trying to solve a puzzle
I won't be a moment
If I was to use this card on that lift now what happens
Can't be as simple as it seems otherwise the bomber wouldn't be directing us towards it
The bust
Hush please
Mercury
Oh but I do
Go and have some more
State of her marriage right there
Lestrade
Oh I'm sorry brother dear but you made a promise
But I deduced Moriarty must have found someone who looked very like me to plant suspicion and that that man whoever he was had to be got out of the way as soon as his usefulness ended
I
Something bad
Nearly cost me my kidneys but fortunately I had a straight flush
Tell them I sent you that ought to get a reaction
Into battle
Perhaps
The wound was on the right side of his head
Most people you can kill any old place
Does a thing thing with peas once
It's all a bit of a blur Detective Inspector
Why is there a draught
Lestrade
Then we move
Thank you
His name
Don't worry
Moriarty is playing with your mind too
Only one in the world
Is it a cap
Course I wasn't
Mrs Hudson Doctor John Watson
Poetry or truth
Lestrade
You won't
Go away
You've been abroad but not sunbathing
One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to to spy on me incognito
This little boy this particular little boy who reads all of those spy books
Musgrave Hall
Huge red eyes
Nicotine patch
Something big's coming isn't it
White supremacist by the tattoo so who cares
Are there ships on it
No no
No time
Miss Mackenzie you're in charge of pupil welfare yet you left this place wide open last night
His belt yes
I know
We've been out for hours
Mycroft I don't do anonymous clients
No
Three years flat if you eat that plum pudding
I'm a fake
This is it though
Who knows
Done that bit
Isn't that what you're supposed to do
Stop smiling
It's a Stradivarius

No
Oh
Two er beers please
No one survives that
It was sold off in a fire damage sale a week ago
Apart from that
Give my love to Mary
Four Three Two
Well you and I are going to have to drive this plane together
Enough to hospitalise me not enough to kill me
I lack the arrogance to ignore details
If you want to communicate why not use e mail
Oh that's a relief
Probably something about trying to make friends
I know a fantastic fish shop just off the Marylebone Road
I am an idiot
It's all here isn't it
As you never cease to announce
Why
He used it to create a false identity so we can use it to break into the records and destroy Richard Brook
I just thought it sort of happened
And you don't
It makes for too much stupid in the room
It's their version of golf
I decline your kind offer
Baker Street
This is important to me
Shut up
Have you got any change for the cigarette machine
Pillars
Maybe
That meant there was a corpse in a morgue somewhere that looked just like me
Family's always difficult
Taxi
So a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around
It wasn't just my reputation that Moriarty needed to bury I had to die
I was there all of it everything
Did you get any information
No thank you Sarah
The world is woven from billions of lives every strand crossing every other
Just that right there
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it
I believe I do
Go on let me in
I'm going to find you
That's not why I'm here
Me
Did you bring your gun as I suggested
Put that in your blog
Sorry
I've just miscounted
I look forward to the court case
I did
We need to identify the corpse
Peru
Oil John
Molly
I'm going to Dartmoor
We're one up on him
The perfect stage for a perfect drama
Who's this
Of course he's my brother
Occasionally
Shall we
Some sort of death frisbee
Yeah that
The driver's trying to fix his engine
Okay
Have another plum pudding
Rest assured Mycroft whatever this underground network of yours is up to the secret will reside in something seemingly insignificant or bizarre
I didn't lie altogether
Well allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom I'd say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four
That was surgery
It can't be you
Sir Eustace is to die tonight
So there was a website for her account
They lied assumed false identities
Meaning
No
Oh God
Did he
Sir Eustace knows this only too well just as he knows why he is to be punished
I said Could you pass me a pen
I was just talking to him
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust
The lie the lie of Leinster Gardens hidden in plain sight
Why shouldn't I
Wrote her phone number down on the napkin
Feeling better
Why would I want to see her again
I don't think John knows where to look
But you've acquired something that's more danger than protection
That's the answer
I presume
People are basically fond
The scream
What
As a mental exercise I've often planned the murder of friends and colleagues
The paper's been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells so it must have been on display in the kitchen
No well I wasn't to know you'd already been exposed to the gas
I favour the latter
Business man
I'd stick with the pasta
Never doubt that Watson
Got any proof
Yes of course
Tom
Superb
Twenty two Northumberland Street
No I helped him put up some shelves
Because I do
D'you like solving crimes
Yes
No the cat doesn't come into it
You haven't opened it
I don't want to die
Me
We're experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats
Absolutely yes
A power play with the most powerful family in Britain
An old one
She's a client
Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together
Why bother
Can I just have a look at it
The question is has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit
I don't know
Yes
The plane will blow up
There's not a moment to lose which one can so rarely say of a morgue
Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him
He is the Napoleon of blackmail and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge
I've been in my Mind Palace of course
All that matters to me is the work
We'll show ourselves out
Dunno
It's all on hard copy in vaults underneath that house and as long as it is the personal freedom of anyone you've ever met is a fantasy
It must be so boring
Done that bit
No
What's wrong
Hangzhou
I won
That just sort of happened
I think it's about to break
But I knew I couldn't believe the evidence of my own eyes so there were seven possible reasons for it the most possible being narcotics
But you know all that
How
I gave an undertaking to protect that man now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast
There was last week but I believe I'm bleeding internally and my pulse is very erratic
I don't want to die
D'you want your wife to be safe
It was a threat
Merry Christmas
No of course not
Mm I know
Oil based used in newspaper print but drawn on with an index finger your finger
Of course you couldn't shoot Magnussen
He was waiting for them
No we've spoken since then
Helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes
I invented the job
It's one possible explanation of some of the facts
That's why they had to go
How
He's practically licked it clean
The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight
Was it you
Lord Moran he's a peer of the realm
So if the driver of the train was in on it then the passenger did get off
Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince it was botulinum toxin
But
This is my friend and colleague Doctor Watson
Back now
PGPR
Entry one
You saw what you expected to see because I told you
YOUNG SHERLOCK Redbeard
The witch's house
How could I refuse
Get me some
What about the day he died
I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary
Exactly
Stupid idea
This one comes from the very first night
She's in on it too
Possibly someone under threat
Urgh
The game was too elaborate
Yes
It means I've got a text
Yep
Oh I know exactly where I'm going
England would fall
Well you have just killed a man
John
Can't even bear to think about you
Whatever's on the phone it's clearly not just photographs
All of this is of course perfectly evident from your perfume
I don't know
Well it's no use now
Look I saw the mark at the circus that tattoo that we saw on the two bodies the mark of the Tong
Scarring pattern on his hands very distinctive fish hooks
We know her address
Seems pretty concerned about you
You're always clever Mary
For the first few months you kept this hidden folded inside a book
The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this so it's had a previous owner
It makes me aware of your existence
Wounded in action then
It's a simple process of elimination
You're hardly an advert for companionship
No don't get it
You've been clever to avoid him so far
We didn't see it
Won't you sit down
What have you done with them
She colour coordinates her lipstick and her shoes
Your move
Bit premature they've only just found the car
And then there's the matter of the other broken window
There's something more than murder he fears
Well usually he must stay above it all
I see
I can bring you home
Ow
Oh hello
Resourceful
Exactly a pint
Rude
This time get it right
I'm sorry what
You know who I am
It can happen sometimes
Happened last night
Can't stand it
Why are you doing all of this
You'd started to piece things together remember what really happened here that night
Loads
Is it clever
There's always an Off switch
Don't be absurd
It's a cup of tea
Far more relaxed about taking bribes
Good then I'll
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go
It's a trick
But then you're not most people I suppose
I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of
Digesting slows me down
He's got a knife
I'm a consulting detective
Perfect
It has to be him
Not alone
Something I need to do
Effectively a costume
What are you
This is not their day job
That plus his arm
Keep talking
Both ends is too much work
All my cuffs have buttons
Oh I don't know
Pass me over
Why '
He was a rubbish big brother
Yes if I wanted poetry I'd read John's emails to his girlfriends
Since this is likely to be the last conversation I'll have with John Watson would you mind if we took a moment
Get away from me John
Good for you
monkey glands
Excellent
The boy sleeps there every night gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor
What's so important about five boring murders
If we're lucky we can see everything that he's been up to
It must be him
Amo amas amat
That was generally me
Of course
Do you have an international reputation
Breaks it off breaks her heart
If I wasn't everything that you think I am everything that I think I am would you still want to help me
My markers agents low lifes people who might find themselves arrested or their diplomatic immunity suddenly rescinded
If they're such good friends why does he barely even mention him
What time is it
I have to understand it
What did you see
Yeah but if you were dying if you'd been murdered in your very last few seconds what would you say
Must be
The invisible army hovering at our elbow attending to our homes raising our children ignored patronised disregarded not allowed so much as a vote
No that's that's not right
Every great cause has martyrs every war has suicide missions and make no mistake this is war
Has it
It's what I've negotiated
Why didn't you come to me in the first place
Why would I be faking
I can feel it
Do you have anything to say in your defence
John
Once more unto the breach dear friends once more
Is that why you're calling yourself Greg
Look at the stamp three attempts at licking
Oh I wouldn't say that
I know but I
Ice lolly it is
That means you're nearly home
It only works if I figure it out
Bitterness is a paralytic
Hmm
What happened to Redbeard
Raoul keeps a very clean house
Anything happening opposite
Look at the turn ups on his jeans
Hmm
Do they really do that
I was nearly there
Carl Powers
That plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish here and I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain
Can I have a box of matches
Is it my birthday
Just faulty
Now we go to the Gallery
Can't remain unmonitored forever
I saw an opportunity
You fail to connect actions to their consequences
I need that analysis
I was nearly there before you stepped on and starting yapping away
I've absolutely no idea
If she'd left him he would have kept it
We need to know the end of this sentence
Oh Mary motherhood's slowing you down
They're pretty formal maybe he was going out for the night but the trousers are heavy duty polyester nasty same as the shirt cheap
Nothing else
Yes
No
I'm measuring the coagulation of saliva after death
Sorry Sebastian
Then rearrange the numbered words to match the sequence on the gravestones
Stop
I meant ex
Yeah well this is more fun
No no tinted eyelashes clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines those tired clubber's eyes
He walked in when they weren't locked
Oh who's this
People were talking none of them me
At long last the spotlight
What are you doing
Terrorists can get into all sorts of problems unless there's an Off switch
You'll be fine once you've excreted it
A woman blows her own brains out in public and you need help identifying the guilty party
Now serviettes
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe
Yes I think so
I actually thought he was improving
Faith
No wait
There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable some kind of institution
He's not a ghost John
Smarter than he looks
Come on
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station
Not sure
NOW would be good
No there's something else
Who is he
Your move
Glasses glasses
I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his jumpers and he can cook
It's not a game
Why would I need you
Eurgh
Ladies and gentlemen pray charge your glasses and be upstanding
There's only so far you can go
Or a touch of the dramatic
You're finally asking the right questions
If he wanted those prisoners free they'd be out on the streets
And your nails you can't afford to do them that often
He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me
Mr Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Colombian peso note in his wallet Quite a bit of change too
He killed Evans
It's used in making chocolate
No murder weapon
No I don't know why
Totally natural
It's an old enough technique known to the kinds of people who can recognise a skip code on sight
I very much doubt it
In the confident expectation I would not have to
No
Is Mycroft with you
Too many jokes about John
That's right the front
Thinking
I've always loved it
Good
The left one
Look at me
I knew I didn't have long
There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now
In detail please
The East Wind takes us all in the end
I felt we had a special something
Just occupying myself
Yes very
It must be so relaxing
My money's on the latter
John
Maybe you're not that into her after all
Please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America
murder
Excuse me
The late Mrs Ricoletti has returned from the grave and with a little skilled make up and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost
I'm just passing the time
And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one and look at you
Of course unmanned aircraft
Everything
Oh use your imagination
Basically
Malnourished double kidney failure and frankly I've been off my tits for weeks
All right then
None of the cabs would take me
Oh excellent news the best
You all work for the same person
We're both on the case
I think I'll surprise John
No you did
He planted it when he came around
Hmm
Phone Lestrade
How are you
The username is her e mail address and all together now the password is
Who's on mortuary duty
What are you still doing here
This phone call it's er it's my note
Don't be smart Sherlock
Oh do your research
Anonymous
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception
And then I phoned back and got one for myself as well
He wants to destroy me inch by inch
Can't have sometimes
I am in hospital
He may wish to say goodbye
Stopped
Hm naturally
Could hit anyone
Why am I doing this again
I'd be lost without my blogger
People don't like telling you things but they love to contradict you
You didn't give these stories to Magnussen did you
Come on John
John
Suggests he's in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him which means he often receives texts and emails he'd rather went unseen
Could be a cousin but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live
With love and many big big squishy cuddles from Stella and Ted
Cup of tea
Hello
Just admiring the view
Anyone ever opt to remember
Biscuits
He died because I shook his hand
I'm sorry
Says the man at the door
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife for one reason only to get near the American embassy which is across the road from your flat
Amazing how fire exposes our priorities
Before we met I discovered everything that I could to impress you
You'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection
The owner always gives me extra portions
Doctor Frankland
Yes
I thought it was a big improvement
Murder Doctor Stapleton
John
Good shot
I don't know who was behind all this but I will find out I promise you
The alarm shows he did regular night shifts
Four assassins living right on our doorstep
So I'm going to need maps lots of maps older maps all the maps
What
Your previous commander Sholto
For one person to be in both groups could be a coincidence
How do you know that you can trust him
Yours
No one ever does that
You
Yes
Umm please could you help me
First hostage from Cornwall the second from London the third from Yorkshire judging by her accent
He made a mistake
Oh
Quite some time in fact
No small plate
Yes you did
I never guess
He organises these things but no one ever has direct contact
Faith
What's in it for me
A bit
One the actual passenger seat the other a good copy
He ran along the window ledge and onto the terrace
Now I'm best pals with all those criminals
and the dying man jumped out of his bed ran straight to the piano and finished it
I'm a high functioning sociopath
You're not being John you're being yourself
and see if anything attacks you
Jonathan Small today's substitute wedding photographer known to us as the Mayfly Man
Took me less than an hour to find the right skip
All the photographs are on here I presume
Interesting isn't it
Given the text I just had you send and the fact that I have her case it's a perfectly logical assumption
Mary lots of love poppet Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from CAM
Why are you still talking about it
Done that bit Hmm
Why
No
What shall we do next
You're formulating a question
Well we're in a good place
There's going to be a loud noise
Unless Do you have a secret you've never told anyone
Show me Appledore
What opinion have I formed of him
All right
Have the shops
Go to the police they're really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff
Pillar of the establishment
Yes I think we are
Did you take it
Some time ago you put pressure on her concerning those letters
The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room
Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely #
I've given him chemicals and compounds that way he's never even noticed
I want to see Appledore where you keep all the secrets all the files everything you've got on everyone
Just hold your nerve on your turning
I'll take your word for it
Oh
Couldn't have chosen it better myself
I didn't solve that one
You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you've worked for but you just couldn't resist it could you
I expect so
You're the one who shot him
If she'd really hurt your feelings you would have had the word obliterated but the first attempt wasn't successful and you haven't tried again so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako hence the indifference
Please let me just go to the kitchen and er dry that off for you
Because said Death I had an appointment with you tonight in Samarra
What about the symbols d'you recognise them
A book that everybody would own
It would seem so
John you are addicted to a certain lifestyle
Mmmmmm not you
Hello Mary
YOUNG SHERLOCK Redbeard
Hardest thing I've ever had to do
Yes
And your pen pal's emails just stopped did they
Apologies for earlier
Thank you blud
Now where is it
You were there for the whole thing up in the gallery start to finish
Of course
This is for a case
Not the fifth of November
D'you want some sauce with that
You're not the woman who came to Baker Street
Everyone's a critic
The hungrier they got the more they ate the faster they died
There is another question that remains however a big one a huge one how would you do it
Of course there's hours of material here but I've cut it down to the really good bits
So clearly he believes I'm a drug addict and no serious threat
That could be anybody
Oh I insist
But enough about Professor Presbury
Hey sis don't mean to complain but this one's empty
Mr Holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound
Moriarty will then use the president as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly which is due to vote on a nuclear non proliferation treaty tipping the balance in favour of a first strike policy against Russia
What about this morning those letters you were looking at
The Adventure of the Invisible Army
Not on the maps but once you eliminate all the other factors the only thing remaining must be the truth
What brings you here in your off duty hours
Most people knock
Oh he's fine
I want to know how good you are
Just tea for me thanks
Can you see it
Whoa whoa whoa
We find the intended recipient and
Obviously
Eyes on Eurus Holmes
Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters
Oh it's way too weird for me
John
No
Uniform fetishist
You two take a bus
That I am what
Where else would you find that level of dexterity
Check again
Bohemian
I want you to calculate John's ideal intake and mine to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening
Really
And you're trying to give up smoking unsuccessfully and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about
In fairness murder is a lot quicker though
But you overdid it Phillip you and your little fan club
Need to examine some bodies
Clearly he's uncomfortable in it
Really
No hold on
Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn't hungry
Then our well timed cyclist put John briefly out of action giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement
The Mayfly Man only saw five women
Certainly
What for
I'd rather keep you guessing
No better than that
You're allowed chips trust me
Of course he's not the boy's father
Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect
It's okay
What for
Certainly
All right
Then why don't you want me to take it
Hallo John
A war hero
Yes of course Rosie
Redbeard
Faith
The plane blows up mid air
Twenty minutes by car
I'm afraid I don't know
Make a paper aeroplane
Ah yes
Let's play a game
I've been expecting this for some time
Walls don't contract after you've painted them
Sorry about dinner
And this one is fifteen
And did those whispers have a name
Probably just noticed something
The painting is a fake
James Moriarty isn't a man at all he's a spider a spider at the centre of a web a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances
Let's talk about
I think I remember the way
They're stealing them back in China and one by one they're feeding them into Britain
But
John you probably want to shut up now
Got any better ideas
It's me come on
You're welcome
Makes it more likely to be a woman
No sorry Doctor Mortimer wins
Oh and they've just had tea and biscuits
Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice
It's murder on the knees
Oh er mmm
John
Why
Why else would he think himself a suspect
God yes
You too what
Different names different addresses
That's it Mary
I tried talking to him
Clearly not one lover she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time so more likely a string of them
Four of them
Ooh
I am yours
Stop the cab
That's why you're so upset
You're right Anderson nothing
She was real
Cost cutting's clearly a priority for you
Her wedding ring
I think in a way it was
More importantly however today we saw two people make vows
Sorry
Hello
Obviously
Rachel is not a name
Looking forward to it
Let's not get ahead of ourselves
What's going to happen
He could be a thousand miles away
It's the mark of a Tong
We're friends
Question is why did she wait until she was dying to write it
Look
Where is he
Yes
Stole something something from the hoard
Um now I tell you what
Yes
Do what
I have your contact details
You know it already
Oh okay
You used that to scare me
The gun
Too tough for them too boring for me
Hmm
Suspected terrorist bomb
It's a cross I have to bear
If I burden myself with a little help mate during my adventures it is not out of sentiment or caprice it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me
Justice
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone never see a drunk's without them
Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town house breaking
Has to be one that they both owned
Have patience Watson
Cause she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name and that's not cheating that's listening
Part two is more action based
We wouldn't do that would we you and me
I don't know how or by whom but it's going to happen
Am I right
Oh what so so so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me
Shut up everybody shut up
It's really not your area
Be calm and answer me
But it has to be in London
What did you say
Mmm Kasbah Nights
You were always right
No I can't leave London at the moment
Where
South of the river too
I thought you weren't my housekeeper
Two streets away but this'll do
sociopath
Hooper
Calm
lax
Getting nowhere
That's what you do best
Because I love it
Not this time
It's just a facade
Hmm you're slipping
That could be brilliant
Do I what
No neither can I
You waited til I had fallen asleep and looked at it
I am sorry
They must have buried it underneath the coffin
If you want to hide a tree then a forest is the best place to do it wouldn't you say
Janus Cars
As per instructions
In fact you're an Army doctor
Not at all
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself cocky or over confident
People text
No one feels inadequate Sherlock Holmes is just an ordinary man
Oh sorry
Hmm
Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets crowded places but nobody saw them go
Oh this is a good one
Clever
Working
Female
They dropped me
I am on the case
Not you
Somewhere in this message it must tell us
Billy Kincaid
Carl Powers
Watson
And they said it was her
One precisely calculated shot to incapacitate me in the hope that it would bide you more time to negotiate my silence
Is that all
Who are they
No
Five pips remember John
Fingertips
I haven't finished yet
Go on
Try to tell me more about the plane
John on the luggage there's a label
Shut up Mrs Hudson
Oh
Yes
Put those back
Of course I've solved it
I need to ask some advice
Young Sherlock I've not been murdered yet
She's trying to tell us something
Fascinating I'm sure
Of course
Indeed
Indicates anxiety a gun held to his head
It was read almost immediately
Stop laughing at me
Are you quite well Watson
He always corrects it
Oh just wondering
Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking
Widowed
Major Sholto
The papers they're painted with mercury
There you see
Don't really need to check that the angle's consistent with self harm do I
Tell me how to save my friend
Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he's dumped the specs
This is my cab
Yeah well be careful what you wish for
Fancy a biscuit with that
He flew back from China then he came here
A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets
Shall I um
A name
I don't have friends
May I see
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint
What's that about
It's another subtle way of smearing my name
Must have read about it and stored it away
The girl on the plane I need to talk to her
Once she had risen anyone could be her
Oh no
That's the one that made the noise yes
It isn't the same phone
I'll pop into Baker Street
That's not the end of the world that's Mrs Hudson
I take a professional interest
It is familiar but er with the quality of surprise
Tell me more
It's all right
Though in fairness he's a drama queen too
What
I'm fine
Okay
Why don't you try this
Shut up John
Absolutely no reason to panic
stop the clock
Burnt to a crisp
Mmm
That's how he made such easy money
End of Baker Street there's a good Chinese stays open til two
Yes
Just put me back in London
Mary
I don't want to die
But describe him
Please don't do that
Hello
That's bad luck isn't it
The Americans wouldn't be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs
Go on then
I hope to see you again in the morning
She planted it on him
Good that we've settled that
Eighteen would get him as far as
Yes
Where are you going
Clearly it's a rare opportunity so it's someone who doesn't get out much
Any ever escape
Hardly new
Victims women
That means he wants to impress her but he's trying to economise on his own food
Beautiful
How I Did It by Jack the Ripper
D'you know why I'm going to take your case
Whilst we were running around the gallery she started to translate the code
John you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now
Paddington Station please
I should hope so
Job
What
Mm
The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens
Only gets us as far as the canteen
Pallor of his skin terminal gin blossoms on his red nose and terror notwithstanding a bad case of the DTs
As I explained the whole street was closed off like a scene from a play
Who
Underground
Ten
Yes but why isn't she answering her phone
You're a doctor
I know it wasn't
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman
He uses his power and wealth to gain information
Let me present Interpol's number one case
I don't understand why would it upset you
Do I
Fragments
Churchill well he's fond of Churchill
I have to finish this
He would never be that disappointing
Thinking
Bye
You're going to have to be strong to resist
What name
If you are referring to romantic entanglement Watson which I rather fear you are as I have often explained before all emotion is abhorrent to me
Yes
Text me the details
I know the signs
Doesn't it bother you
We're losing him
What was that noise downstairs
Loves to exaggerate
How did you manage to get out of this place
Mary I'm sorry to tell you this but he wants you dead
Play the music again please thank you
Not good
Do come in
That was a number as well
Stop
This
That's all he heard
sociopath
No
Is that the best you've got
for a secretary
If you've got any kind of a problem money troubles bad marriage whatever Janus Cars will help you disappear
Er um er
Interesting name Eurus
What's the matter with you
Jade
Hmm
It's the London A to Z that they're using
Nobody noticed the earring
People would just walk straight past not knowing unable to decipher the message
I've seen those symptoms before
Beats like digits
Scuse me
We've had some frustrating cases
But um I'll tell you mine
Describe him to me
Hope you remembered my coat
Then why don't you show us
So what have we got
Screw the top
Your place
You will look after him for me won't you
You're going to tell the truth Mycroft pure and simple
Is it intentional
I meant your playing
Would they risk dragging him off
Henry Fishgard never committed suicide
Even I text
Right
Exactly
Mycroft's men intervened before he could take the shot
Will you excuse me a moment
Serial killers are always hard
I play the violin when I'm thinking
Jewish folk story
Well no seventeen and a half to be precise but I rounded up for dramatic effect so please do show us your favourite room
Tell me about your boss Moriarty
Downstairs
It was perfectly simple
Oh we're done waiting
This way
She could afford better but she's kept it it's sentimental
Yeah you
Size of the hat
Anderson don't talk out loud
Okay four ideas
He's entitled
Yesterday only one of those pots was shining
Oh
Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind
That was that was
You went out with her for two years
Why
Even you lot couldn't miss them
Would maybe nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit
Hmm
Somewhere here in the code
What does that matter
Ooh this is getting rather fun isn't it
Yes where is it
Too bad
Yes I'm sure you do Henry
We all will
Is it a city
Maybe you liked his wife maybe you don't like his drinking
Do what
There's something important about this
If I hadn't come back you wouldn't be standing there and you'd still have a future with Mary
Of what
It's been brilliant
I feel the same
I don't know where but
He loved those shoes remember
The only mystery is this why is my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting
Oh those things you said such sweet things
Have I missed anything
She's smiling in that one
Having driven to an isolated location and successfully committed a crime without a single witness why would he then call the police and consult a detective
Oh shut up
Well let's not jump to conclusions
It's still a secret
Ten a penny
She would like those letters back
Can I borrow your microscope
And the blindfold the horizontal line
I was able to help out
Careful
Gavin Lestrade
Yeah of course
I know ash
So it's a superficial job then
Take my card
Where is it
What did you hear Ajay
No
Hooper
You may speak freely in front of him as he rarely understands a word
Enigmatic
No shouldn't think so
Client
Boffin Sherlock Holmes
You thought she was having an affair
Oh your face
Linseed oil
No
The Chinese number one John
What
Sorry
I need to get some air
You've been very helpful
You have missed this
But we needed him to see a body
Get down
Yes I know
Moriarty's dead
Just going to take him out for a bit run him
There's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet
No rain anywhere in London in that time
I mean you missed almost everything of importance but um you know
Oh yes
Twenty two Northumberland Street
Why have I got this blanket
Yeah
Seriously it's not a joke
More importantly who could you only kill at a wedding
Could have been both
You're putting me off
Keep talking
Taught you how to cut up a beast
Factoring in a degree of shock an emotional decision and a journey time based on the associated address I'd say that your life as you know it has twenty minutes left to run
You're the cabbie
Please do relax
The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you
Governor's orders
I
No door knobs no letter box painted windows
If I die here my body will be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it
We'll have to risk it
Now we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen apart from one thing you don't take sugar in your coffee
Anything you say Giles
Bottle almost finished
Those marks on your forearm edge of a desk
Who are you
Now Howard
Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did
Er
You believed that
Did you fake it for them
For whom
That waistcoat's clearly newer than the jacket
Nice
My name's Sherlock Holmes
Still a bit troubled by the daughter
So what do you keep on here in general I mean
She took the kids but you still love them and it still hurts
Henry remember
What did you see that changed everything
I need you to concentrate
As ever you see but do not observe
You're you're really keeping this
Ah Anderson
You know what it was
I want to see your handbag
So dead two days
I sent a text from your phone remember
Clearly
Why did you end it
You bring me tea in the morning
That's the question
John
We've got plenty of time
He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father and he had the means right at his feet a chemical minefield pressure pads in the ground dosing you up every time that you came back here
The first part of your conversation was in fact pre recorded video
Ah the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two
The Van Buren Supernova
Acquainted with the process of death but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal
Still
It's a pearl
And you know which is which
No witnesses I suppose
Oh
Ah but there's more
Who was that
What do they have to do
Oh Mrs Hudson the landlady she's giving me a special deal
You'll drop them into the sea
Now he appears after lunch in the company of a man of military aspect with a tan and recent injury both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan and an enforced departure from it
You don't want money or power not really
Just do as I ask
If this woman leaves London without putting her dog into kennels I need to know
Um How how how long was I away
A gigantic hound
You're not here
Other than yourself
Security
You go on ahead Henry
Size eight feet
Oh well
Good day
Afghanistan or Iraq
Yeah but if you were clever really clever Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers she was clever
Yeah
He he's downstairs
Go on
I wouldn't miss this for the world
I know exactly who that is
Sorry what
Major Sholto's going to be murdered
There were other images of Margaret Margaret
Also the lining of the coffin
Of course you've wasted police time perverted the course of justice risked distracting me from a massive terrorist assault that could have both destroyed Parliament and caused the death of hundreds of people
She she destroyed it
To look after the three of you
I'll take the case
Sixteen by six
John
It's no use there's no other way
Still just chance
Very well said the merchant
Now well that might mean nothing except for the angle of the scars on your left forearm you know under that sleeve that you keep pulling down
I lost count
Numbers come with partners
Ah
The clever one
He used a diamond
Realised what
What if I don't choose either
They're not retro they're original
There's every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers
Your mouth's too small now
Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds orange pips things like that
I assume she was capable of finding a reason
In any case I know I would be very much at home in such a world
Ammo
The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage
Excellent
Dust is eloquent
I'm restoring balance to the universe
We um we grew up together
Wait til she finds out about the one in Islamabad
Who do we trust even if we don't know them '
There's been a fourth
Oh stupid
My suicide
Yes I am
Barnicot's house then
Secondly a system of Japanese wrestling
Golem
Tried to talk me into doing it
Well then let's help you solve your little problem Greg
Oh this had better be good
Plain as the nose on your
That's enough to be going on with don't you think
Look at the hem of it
Of course
Am I the current King of England
What
I do that sometimes
You maintain an impressive facade
I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I'd invited Moriarty onto the roof
If one disregards the ghost there is only one suspect
Hatton Garden
Yes there are
If that's the sort of thing you're looking for the man over there in blue is your best bet
Now that we know his victims were abducted that changes everything
Not much
I'm not the police
I'm not the Commonwealth
Rosamund
Well why would they be interested
No
A Study in Pink
Enough chatter
What for
This isn't torture this is vivisection
It's quite simple
How's the plane going to fly
He never tells anyone
It's funny
I said you can turn it off now
Had what
Next
Brilliant Anderson
No I mean what airport are you
The kitchen is the most public room in any house but since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this I have to assume you don't have any
You can if you like
Binary code
And stay out of my bedroom
Brilliant
Depends on the book
I have to go back
Yes
Well it's hardly my fault you weren't listening
I used to think I was an idiot
May I ask how is your husband this morning
Who the hell are you
Her coat it's slightly damp
Rug
The journey between those stations usually takes five minutes
Thank you
Well let's see shall we
What
No
If this man cancels his papers
I don't see smart and I definitely don't see trustworthy but I'll give you a quote if you like three little words
Where exactly
John please can you check those flight schedules see if I'm right
That's why they think they're safe
She was John's therapist
I look at you and I see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them
May need longer
I am clean
Hi
But we want something very particular for this special day don't we
You're not a fan at all
Good excellent
Arrived from China a month ago Chinese ceramic statue sold four hundred thousand
Damn
I forgot to factor in the traffic
That's not the police
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs
Visible above the waistline very visible very particular brand
Stop it NOW
I never say that
Sorry did I say murder
What do we know about this corpse
Dunno
Dinner
I simply observed
I'll get you out of this
There's more
Laters
It's one of your old boyfriends we're trying to track him down
Moriarty's back
No one had any cause to go near his car so there he remained in the driver's seat hidden until
How did I get here
Went through the open window
Gun in the mouth a bullet through the brain back of the head blown clean off
John
Does the river look like it's getting closer
I've phoned Lestrade
Watson restore the courage of Scotland Yard
No need for that now
Why
Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric and you wouldn't even feel it
Oh really
Mrs Ricoletti I believe
No not American left hand drive that's what I mean
Ah but there's more
He got into the shower and then someone stabbed him
Somebody doesn't want me to see it
Two years eleven months and four days
Does er does yours rub off too
Tell me has Sir Eustace spent time in America
John
Married
Have you written up your account of the case
Did you see his watch
Forget spectres from the otherworld
Tell me what you want from me
Yes it was Adams
Because he'd recently had a booster jab
Oh
I'm just gonna whip this out
What happened
Nicked it yesterday
And a soldier as you keep reminding us all
Experiment complete
I'm Sherlock Holmes
He stole the treasure when he was in China
Mycroft never texts if he can talk
But you didn't
D'you leave your windows open when you go on holiday
Well then I'd be soaking wet too wouldn't I
You know I value your little contributions
Old friend
Scout's honour
No problem
You see the fold in the middle
The door's been opened recently
I'm home
Now show me to the stream
You need low tar
Where did you take off from
I could never resist a gong
But I did see it so the question is how
Well you know let the cat out of the bag
She gave us most of the missing pieces
No not Mary
For what
Your mind has created the perfect metaphor
Sure
Yes
Gonna go and see Van Coon's P.A
Well I believe that I can
I said I'd bring her home
What if I don't want a gun
You know Henry Knight
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height
We don't know that it was suicide
Out of my head
Did I get anything wrong
It's too bizarre it's too baroque
And you invaded Afghanistan
No
You heard it too
Are you all right
Maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon
Dated a ghost
Molly please without asking why just say these words
I've never begged for mercy in my life
You you had a row with a machine
How good a shot are you
Of course you do John
Bought off
Or close the wall up with our English dead
Who's that
Don't drink Mary's tea
No
Oh
You've heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen of course
Victor Trevor
Heard you the first time
Tell me
Absolutely no idea
How powerful
The average arrival time for a London ambulance is
One librarian two teachers two high pressured jobs probably the City
Apparently it's going to save the world
No no
Has to be um
What are you
So once again who could you only kill here
He told us he hadn't been abroad recently but when I asked him about the cars I could see his tan line clearly
Somewhere in this street somewhere near
My plan needs darkness
Alex Woodbridge
She'd applaud your choice of words
Mrs Hudson
And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that
How many photographs
This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it
Must have had a reason
I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant
Is a phone call possible
I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade
Stop
So yes
They have been in here
Here you go fifty
Ready to go Molly
The crime happened exactly as I explained
Then what exactly is the point of you
Oh I think you know what
You'll never find him
No it can't
You didn't need to come in Molly
Wasn't it
He's straightened the knocker
Only a Jumbo is wide enough to need the letter K or rows past fifty five which is why there's always an upstairs
No not you
Go away
So who came to my flat
What
Everything you did for me
Thank you
Her I mean
You should be at Baker Street
And since killing someone in public is difficult killing them in private isn't an option
I confess at first I didn't realise he was asking me
Ladies and gentlemen family and friends and erm others
You're looking for cheap accommodation but you're not going to your brother for help that says you've got problems with him
Is it in your coat
Nice stationery
His hands were steady
I hardly knew myself Mrs Hudson
The porch where we came in
Sorry I
Shut up
Don't bring a gun
There isn't time to talk to the police
Wounded in action suntan Afghanistan or Iraq
Moriarty is dead
We're to be accorded every courtesy Doctor Stapleton
Did your husband describe
Now I'm just an idiot but I'm on the ground
See
What
Both of them smuggled stuff out and the Lucky Cat was their drop off
Course it's not a trick
Putting my best man onto it right now
Brother of West's fiancee
Okay I'm ready now
Yes
It is never twins Watson
No
Moriarty
And exotic dancing
And I shall have to go deeper still
What's your favourite
That's all you need to know
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her
How about them
You've been a while
Doctor Watson Sergeant Sally Donovan
Must be staring me in the face
I'm not a hero
Don't you understand
Frown lines suggest a lifetime of peering
Actually now I can
They're warning us it's gonna happen again
Dear Jim
Sex doesn't alarm me
Address
You're not lost any more
Yes
Excellent reflexes
Don't try to trick me
She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails
You were thinking
Botox injection
It's nothing to worry about
Quite clear
Why did he paint it so near the tracks
Mm
Oh she doesn't matter
He's smart computers can be hacked
Often they're the same thing
Wait
You were advertising all the way through the trial
I've got nothing to go on
I'm not involved
I'm so much cleverer
Don't make people into heroes John
It's got flaps ear flaps
I consider you under his thumb
A gigantic man made of clay
Get off my sheet
You're the expert
Our acrobat
#G wireless
I'm undercover
There are all those furtive little meetings in cafes those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone
I'm your best
He's broken his pattern
She's been married at least ten years but not happily
Anything to add John
One place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased
Icelandic sheep wool
I'm waiting for an explanation Inspector
This is cleaner more efficient
All good wishes for your special day
We're meant to
Molly please
All right
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago limited edition of six
He said you betrayed him
He could be
Dropped the package delivered it and then stopped on his way
Not you
Oh
Greg
H. H. Holmes
The numbers always appear randomly and not in sequence but the letters have little runs of sequence all over the place families and couples sitting together
Very good
Another in here
Bow Street Runners missed everything
Nice of him to give us his number
Who
Of course not
Took him years to confide in me
Why do you call it a hound
That would be an appalling waste of brain space
Do give her my love
Between you and me John I always survive a fall
Five pips
I've said it all before
I estimate we have a minute left
I don't think this can wait
Ooh
They're taken to a special room and burned
Come home and everything will be all right I promise you
Doctor Watson
John if we're going to decipher this code we're gonna need to look for more evidence
First word then every third
I left it at the crime scene
I know a real gun when I see one
Elite Guard
I confiscate it
Well where else was I supposed to put it
Chalk chalky clay that's a far thinner band of geology
Speed differential won't be as critical as the distance
The whole compartment is the bomb
I made me
That's
Could you do some digging as a favour
She's from out of town though
John have a cup of tea make yourself at home
Mmm
No
ties
Could be dangerous
Also he's a comics and sci fi geek
No
A friend
Yes
Bit mean springing it on you like that I know
If she'd treated him he'd have had as much as he wanted
Get me a fresh glass of water please
Has to be a unique opportunity
Have you seen him
I didn't
unless I kill myself complete your story
Yes
John
You'd be surprised
What are you Wikipedia
I have a list
Have a bit of respect
Sorry gotta dash
We have to find out what connects these two men
Magnussen
I applaud the spectacle
There's nothing I can do to help
There's a train that leaves in half an hour so if you want
I will
Done that
About
It's funny cause it's true
Because you chose her
How does it work
Is it
We all have a past Watson
There was only one thing left to do
Mrs Hudson
No
Exactly
Get his attention
and of course I have to mention the elephant in the room
and contrast is after all God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot
CIA trained killers at an excellent guess
Conclusion relationship is over
I need a moment to um figure out what I'm going to do
Acceptably hot
Same way you catch any other killer
It's not a pleasant thought John but I have this terrible feeling from time to time that we might all just be human
There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling
I suppose that was obvious given our first meeting at the swimming pool his death wish
No
John you amaze me
We've had a break in at Baker Street
You know what
Um er
I needed a hug
Who's on forensics
Where did that happen
Because Mrs Hudson's right
Could you all just shut up for five minutes
Or I'll just walk away
Was it his own car
Taken in large enough quantities eventually it would kill them
This is all for a case
Don't you see
No
No no no I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter
You wait here
Ah Moriarty is smart
Don't wait up
I'll find him in ten minutes
Why
Thirty seven nine thirty seven nine Nine mill for
It's time to lay this ghost
None at all
But that that's exactly what they must have done
It's a memory inhibitor
The Woman
Watson
The fifth substance it's part of the tale
Bye
Not as far as I know
No never do that
Guilt is eating away at his soul
Young Sherlock Why not
I want every book from Lukis apartment and Van Coon's
Mycroft
You said he'd felt unwell
I'm in shock
Oh
Rachel
Just let him
No they're not destroying them
Hm
Well I like you
Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him but it was through his belt
Why
I've never even heard him say his name
Are you there yet
You couldn't cope
I hope the contents make up for any inconvenience I may have caused you tonight
And he's just done something very suspicious indeed
Ah Sergeant
John
Want to know how we're going to break in
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean
Everything they said about me
Oh I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie
What
Nine
I'm on a case
I had to
Shame on you John Watson
John
You me and Eurus
Then you are in luck
Really hope you don't have a baby in here
There's a kid I know hacker brilliant hacker one of the world's best
Two men alone in the countryside several yards apart and one car
And he had a spy to hand
I need your help
How much blood was on that seat would you say
Or blood in a butchers
I need to try
Heaviest oil deposit's always on the first key used that's quite clearly the three but after that the sequence is almost impossible to read
You're clearly just back from your holidays
The song was never a set of directions
Fine
She chose to give it up
Printed at one in Piccadilly
In saving my life she conferred a value on it
Is this a confession
Yeah
Oh don't bother being astonished
What are you an idiot a drunk or a criminal
Me
No
Yeah but there was a dog Henry leaving footprints scaring witnesses but it was nothing more than an ordinary dog
Yep
What
Have a nice day
Oh there's Daddy
It's an Underground network
U.M.Q
This way
Seriously
Oh forget him
This is low tar
All the time in the world to create an alibi
I know that silence
What are you seeing
Look seven carriages leave Westminster but only six carriages arrive at St James's Park
It's Mary
Normally he'd sit in the House
Worth thirty million pounds
So that's him
How ya feelin
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti
Doesn't appear we have a choice
Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity and instead of endless nights in watching the telly or going to barbecues with awful dreadful boring people he couldn't stand he used his wits cleverness and powers of disguise to play the field
Not now
Yes it is
Sometimes to solve a case one must first solve another
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face
Give me a name
You're my friend
How was what done
Unlikely you've got an extended family certainly not one you're close to so brother it is
According to Mycroft
Yes
But it is what it is
Oh they're probably paw prints could be anything therefore nothing
Joe Harrison's flat
Or that one
I'm meeting him in three hours
He blew his own brains out
Cooked breakfast or the nearest thing those trains can manage
Stay calm stay calm
I don't know
Don't make jokes Molly
That's my girl
I'll leave you to your deductions
I never really say that
I need a bath
Of course it is
The newspapers were right all along
Oh please
Death waits for us all in Samarra
I said excuse me
Where is she
But it's not enough to kill them on its own
Mind if I join you
Tell us more about your case Mr Harcourt
Pressure on facing a deadline
But if it's corrupted how do they know it's not Magnussen
tie
Not now John
Then get out
Someone private perhaps obsessed with personal security
Yes
I'm used to mystery at one end of my cases
Can't do that
Who employed you
So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour or I'm telling the truth
I need to think
Copy of The Downing Street Years one two three four five separate biographies of Thatcher
I feel scared

The orange pips were a reminder
Who have I been talking to all this time
Whose idea was that
The book John
I'm here
Please
Open your eyes
The boy was made to walk ahead of them
Give her some lines
The game yes
Bad Samaritan
Not you
However it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me
I am lost Help me brother Save My Life Before my Doom
Obvious
Yes I would
I just need to talk about the the rent
Examine me
Sometimes I don't talk for days on end
H O U N D
The expense of the phone says wife not girlfriend
I shall have to go deep
I assumed you'd choose something more specific than that but um thanks anyway
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders as the work of a ghost to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard
Never liked riddles
Got a theory
It's coming to get you
The luggage
Can you decipher these
UMQRA
None of you reported anything stolen
I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I'm flattered by your interest I'm really not looking for any
That's right
Thank you John
London is in danger John
When does the path we walk on lock around our feet
Yeah there's nothing to it
What is she
Goodbye John
Kenny Prince's houseboy
Think I just did didn't I
Obsessive compulsive
Most people
If you fire it the bullet will travel at over a thousand metres per second
Grown ups like that sort of thing
Standard procedure
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband
This is his hunting ground right here in the heart of the city
Major Sholto
You do see you just don't observe
About a note
William Sherlock Scott Holmes
I wanted to hear your confession needed to know I was right
Wiggins has got your money by the gate

Twenty five at most
Thank you
Just tell me what happened from the beginning
Nothing
It's my brother's

How true of you the combination to your safe your measurements but this this is far more intimate
I totally had you
The women I we have lied to betrayed the women we have ignored and disparaged
I said no she's not an hysteric
No
Good because this is going to be incredibly dangerous
Someone else has been here
No
What and I didn't notice it
Well you've already done it
There for all to see
Would that bother you
You will
Of course one should but not at John's wedding
It was doubt
I'm very busy
Come on think
Bad idea try not to but you know sometimes
Oh dull
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something like a proper big brother
He did his best
Sixty thirty five
Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning wouldn't you agree
That wasn't a miss
Tell me nothing about him
Well somebody got hold of the phone and apparently as a joke personalised their text alert noise
Oh hello
He got peckish
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
If you could break any bank what do you care about the highest bidder
The question is who
Mary
I want you to kill me
It's too slow
A lie that's preferable to the truth
Portable Appledore
Ladies and gentlemen will you all please get on your knees
Solved it
No
I know that face
Not ammo as in ammunition but amo ' meaning
Sorry
It's my face
Remember that one John
All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved
It's a fifty fifty chance
I think he wants to be distracted
Sometimes a deception is so audacious so outrageous that you can't see it even when it's staring you in the face
Look at this one
John
If you're feeling kind lock her up otherwise let her go
Remind me when was the last time that it rained
The East Wind is coming Sherlock
MRS HUDSON
This is the work of a single minded person someone who knew first hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty
Not at all
She came to see me because she was scared of her daddy
What's that silver thing on top of it Mycroft
I am known to be indestructible
Easily arranged
All right I'll find you
Hopkins arrest Wilson
It's not a trick
Kill him with what
I'm not telling you
Molly
So he's brought the letters to London so no matter what he says he's ready to make a deal
Who are you working for this time Dzundza
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger though so strong moral principle
Why else the portentous threat

I don't understand
Not what
You have seen the ballistics report I suppose
I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal
Which was it Afghanistan or Iraq
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone which means your blog has a far wider readership
You've been abroad a lot
I wasn't dead
No
And am I a man
Has it never occurred to you that your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse
I'm cold
But for now part two
Planned and rehearsed
I need to go to the bank
The evidence was right under your nose John
I was looking out of the window
Over there
How quaint
Maybe
I'm sorry
Why are you doing this
A Christmas present
Oh I can't be the only person in the world that gets bored
I'm just a cock
I bet it was Donovan
Holmes
Joining me

Looking takes ages
The obliquity of the ecliptic

I
Maybe it's because of the material more likely the hideous pattern suggesting it's a present probably Christmas
Gone
Is my brother in
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in
Moriarty's network took me two years to dismantle it
Simple
With that level of personal grooming
You really do have to wear the outfit
Would you Would you like to
How did you find me
Ah Hudders
Not that obvious a trick
Serial killer active during the Chicago Fair
Isolated too don't you think
See how they got in
Keep trying

Thank you
There will be two passcodes one to open the phone one to burn the drive
Oh Mike Stamford I see
Quiet calm peaceful
What sort of hat is it anyway
It's okay
She doesn't
I saw you take it
Lawyer
In the Second World War the Allies knew that Coventry was going to get bombed because they'd broken the German code but they didn't want the Germans to know that they'd broken the code so they let it happen anyway
Mycroft fed Moriarty information about me
You want to help right
Light headed good
Watson your hat and coat
What what did you do
Clearly
It's not specific to this place
See what
You know it's interesting
Thank you
No
Well
Let's arrange a little meeting
Please for God's sake just stop it
Is that where this leads
It's all right it's all right
It's a bit suspicious isn't it
Well I'm not now
Therefore he owes me a favour
Mr Ewert's a liar
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time
Dear God what is it like in your funny little brains
It's a camera phone
Problem
Not you
Do stop loitering by the door and come in
Sorry you were saying
I'm not a psychopath Anderson
The only broken window in this establishment is the one that Watson and I entered through yet prior to that we distinctly heard the sound of What did you just say
Must be

John
We're looking for a dog yes a great big dog that's your brilliant theory
A secret terrorist organisation's planning an attack that's what secret terrorist organisations do isn't it

It's obvious isn't it
Novel

Those floating flat faces those dead eyes That's what he is
I expected a pearl

Both bottles are of course identical
Can you see it
That's not important
Can I elp you with anything sir
A recluse small household staff
I am looking at you
She used a fountain pen
Reckon we've got another half an hour of light
They always do
Watching the birds
Impress me then
Mycroft has a file
Well obviously it's not the same phone but it's supposed to look like
I've just handed you a murder enquiry
You didn't take anything because you don't need to
Unless they have help
As they go
None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen
I love the brilliant ones
She splits the sandbag the sand pours out gradually the weight lowers into the bowl
Why did Bluebell have to die Doctor Stapleton
NATO's in uproar
Sorry about that
Even you
John has a daughter
Good luck boys
Not much cop this caring lark
Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon that's a crack shot you're looking for but not just a marksman a fighter
All the nice girls like a soldier
Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention particularly a man which is statistically more likely so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it
Cocaine
There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on
Which is why this is going to be so much harder
Hungry
Don't move
You want to take me to the station
Yes
Mary you do
Control
No it has to be a drug
Do you see them
How Why would she do that
A moment
Any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive
It's a countdown
I need to know
Anyone else even tries security is automatically informed
I thought so
The best and bravest man I know and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff
But in my defence it was very funny
Ahh too many too many too many too many
No
This is hard
Thank you
Stop talking
Yes y you did
The same thing inside the house
That message was intended for someone who came in at midnight
Maybe our friend's somewhere in the back of the picture someone who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in # Maybe somebody who says cell phone because of time spent in America
Am I not
And of course because he's in town tonight the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of Great Britain from seven til ten
That is his trademark style

I don't know
Yes great wonderful
I never could resist a touch of drama
Repeat your exact words from a moment ago exactly as you said them
Best man I ever knew
Hutch still locked no sign of a forced entry Ah
Kettle's just boiled
Then get into the car and drive away
What if you had the compulsion to kill and money
She's turned it up against the wind
There's nowhere else it could be
John
John Watson you keep me right
It's always you
I don't know
Found you
Only the very front section of the house remains
I met someone tonight the same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher
They're not that stupid
Go away
The best man
I didn't notice
Five's excessive behaviour
No they don't
Look at the size of your kitchen teeny tiny
He was over the moon
Oh Christ

Luck
What's wrong
The ashtray
I've never made a vow in my life and after tonight I never will again
What
He's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for
The angle was too steep
How so
Look at all the practice you've had
He looks ancient
Soldiers
Hmm
Right sir
It's where he started though and he's never lost the certainty the obsession that that drug really could work
It wasn't an animal was it Henry
There's only one place he'll go to back to where it all started
Brilliant impression of an idiot
What about her
He pulled the trigger
And I just caught you a serial killer more or less
You need to question her
What do you make of it
Not yet
Yeah but that was ages ago
Watson is equally culpable
The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself but rather the iron chain of reasoning from cause to effect that reveals step by step the solution
It's not carrying explosives
Right turn one way roadworks traffic lights bus lane pedestrian crossing left turn only traffic lights
What do we do
How was it described
Come on where is her case
Perfectly safe as long as we avoid touching the rails
I glanced at it but I'd prefer to hear it from you
Certainly endeavouring to sir
Oh you mean he's yours
Your deodorant told me that
It was a long shot anyway
Yes it is
Why was I your favourite
It's an ancient device
What's that
So what's this all about Mr Shilcott
I think she liked me
It's through there isn't it
You were a doctor who went to war
It's er completely identical
I've got lots of coats
She's got an umbrella in her left hand pocket but it's dry and unused not just wind strong wind too strong to use her umbrella
Solved it then
Good one though
Scotland Yard
Look it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister
He died there and then
Don't know why but there's something wrong with it
I don't know who you're supposed to be
Her case
Hm that perks things up a bit
I'm sorry I'm not there at the moment
You may as well eat
There's nothing wrong with me
I don't care what people think
My eyes and ears all over the city
No no no not now not now

You must find him guilty
Goodbye Mr Knight
Of course I'm gonna miss dinner
John asked me to be his best man
She saved my life

I thought that the drug was in the sugar so I put the sugar in your coffee then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore
It was you not your passenger
Basically it's a cute smile to the bride's side cute smile to the groom's side and then the rings
So in fact You you mean
Well it could be an aunt or an elder sister but mother's more likely
Close your eyes
Wasn't that difficult a leap
What did you say
It's perfectly simple
The mortuary your favourite room
You weren't wearing lipstick before
Must be possible
Now Van Coon
Hours later he dies
You phoned him
That's what I checked when I went to the window

You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle
Even under duress you can't know which one she's given you and there will be no point in a second attempt
I'm quite sure
Maybe it's not
Hope you didn't mess up my sock index this time
Redbeard
You've put on three pounds since I last saw you
I'm not the first
You should have driven faster
You're suicidal alone and strapped for cash yet you're still cooking to impress
It took effort
I need to know how you got out of here
Oh errrrrr
Molly Hooper and some of my homeless network and that's all
Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic and take your clothes off to make an impression
But he's clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual
Well why didn't you ask her
Oh come on
Just arrived
No I don't
Er no no no they were just leaving
No Mrs Watson
Because of the one impossible thing you've said
Didn't you hear me
You look different
Yes
Imagine
It matches
A divorcee's more likely to look for a new partner a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband
Mmmm pub crawl themed
No
How
Oh sorry didn't I say
It vanishes between St James's Park and Westminster
Have you sent it
Handbag
Maybe she left it when she left her case
Don't be boring
I cleared it a bit
It's not there
Gas leak apparently
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one
Oh we must have been staring right at it
He's treating her to a meal but his own portion is small
It is a fact I believe that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day
Think we'll call it a draw

That's nice
You're a detective broadly speaking
You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different
Oh God
I meant to say marriage but you know they're quite similar procedures when you think about it

Vivian Norbury who outsmarted them all
Standard key card for the building
Er ooh
He's trying to communicate with his people in the underworld
It's a fake
Hmm
Sorry John
But the one thing I didn't anticipate was just how far Moriarty was prepared to go
Yes
I've missed you fumbling round the place
No need for stimulants now remember
Why are you crying
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady
Well before the police come in and spoil things why don't we just enjoy the moment
Oh don't be stupid
Girlfriend
Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers

I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside

It is a fake
Did she faint
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains
It's right underneath the Palace of Westminster
Obvious
Yes
Faith
It's been displayed on a dummy for many years in a case facing south east judging from the fading of the fabric
Anything
Pick what
Describe him
People live here for years and never see it but if you are what I think you are it'll take you less than a minute
Just sort of happens really
Why here

Oh I think you're a lot more careless than you let on
Somebody must know something about it
I knew it wouldn't end like this
I've still got it so when I tell you that this is the most dangerous the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered when I tell you that this this monster must be ended please remember where you're standing because you're standing exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago
Additionally I thanked him for the trust he'd placed in me and indicated that I was in some ways very close to being moved by it

I want a name
There's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that's to

What if one of them stole something
Magnussen's private lift

Eurus you said the answer's in the song but I went through the song line by line all those years ago and I found nothing
Yes
But there were still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he put the cream on his feet
He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car
I presume that's not a problem
Do go on
Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders
Can't you see what's going on
The signs of three
